<p class="rm-manual">[N.B.: This article previews my 1990 book, <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/books/rushdie.php">The Rushdie Affair: The Novel, the Ayatollah, and the West</a>.]</p> </blockquote> <p> </p><p>In
 the span of a decade, the Ayatollah Khomeini has twice challenged 
Western civilization's deepest norms. By permitting a seizure of the 
American embassy, in November 1979, he violated the most hallowed laws 
of Western diplomacy. In February 1989, he struck again, by calling for 
the murder of British novelist Salman Rushdie, and of his publishers.</p> <p>So
 far as an outsider can tell, Khomeini issued his recent edict to resist
 what he sees as a threatening, secular West. The chief irony of the 
affair, therefore, was that Khomeini succeeded in demonstrating how few 
in the West are prepared to stand up for its values - and least of all 
his chief intended victim, Salman Rushdie.</p> <h3>I. The Author</h3> <p>Salman
 Rushdie was born in 1947 in Bombay, India. He attended school at Rugby,
 followed by King's College at Cambridge University, from which he 
graduated in 1968. After spending two years in Pakistan, he returned to 
Britain, where he has lived ever since, becoming a British subject by 
marriage. For several years, Rushdie served as an editor in a public 
relations firm; then, in 1976, he published his first novel, Grimus, a 
work of science fiction. A second book, Midnight's Children, came out in
 1979, won the Booker prize in 1981, and sold an impressive half-million
 copies. A 1981 novel, Shame, which dealt with Pakistan, also won high 
critical acclaim.</p> <p>The Iranian press has called Rushdie "a 
self-confessed apostate," but he is better described as a lapsed Muslim,
 and he makes no bones about it: "I do not believe in supernatural 
entities," he has said, "whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or Hindu." 
Though Rushdie is hardly alone in his views, what he stands for perturbs
 many Muslims. They take particular offense because he has renounced his
 ancestral country, language, and the Muslim way of life, adopting 
instead England, English, and secularism.</p> <p>But though Rushdie has 
adopted England as his home, he has hardly taken it to his bosom. The 
immigration officials who arrest one of his characters behave like the 
goons of a police state, "thumping and gouging various parts of his 
anatomy" in such a way that the bruises will not show. As Cheryl Benard 
of the Baltzman Institute in Vienna concludes, it is not Muslims who 
come off worst in Rushdie's vision. "It is Britons more than Moslems who
 might have cause to find the book 'blasphemous.' If Islam is portrayed 
as somewhat rigid and medieval, then the contemporary West, in his 
pages, is a nightmare out of 'Blade Runner.'" New York City he calls 
"that transatlantic New Rome with its Nazified architectural gigantism, 
which employed the oppressions of size to make its human occupants feel 
like worms." In the cruder terms of one of his characters, the West 
comprises "the motherfucking Americans" and "the sisterfucking British."</p> <h3>II. The Satanic Verses Incident</h3> <p>Nevertheless,
 it must be admitted, The Satanic Verses is an elusive and sophisticated
 tale, written by an accomplished novelist. Unfortunately, to assess the
 offensiveness of the book in Muslim eyes, the novel must be looked in a
 literal and anti-literary way, for this is the way it is understood by 
those who protest it. Specifically, one must take every statement in the
 book as representative of the author's own thinking, even though this 
is clearly not always the case.</p> <p>The Satanic Verses is not easy to
 summarize. It contains three stories which at first glance may appear 
unrelated. The first story (taking up chapters 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) 
concerns two Indians (Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha) who fall out
 of a jumbo jet and miraculously survive. Their adventures in England, 
their fantasy worlds, and their eventual return to Bombay makes up the 
novel's central plot.</p> <p>The second story (in chapters 2 and 6) is a
 dream about aspects of the story of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. It 
relies partly on historical fact, partly on the novelist's imagination. 
The third story (in chapters 4 and 8) concerns a Muslim village in India
 whose whole population follows a holy woman into the Arabian Sea, 
expecting the waters will part for them to walk to Mecca. But the waters
 remain unparted, and virtually the whole village perishes. Juxtaposed 
as it is with a description of Khomeini's exile in Paris, Rushdie 
clearly intends this to be seen as an allegory for Iran and the Islamic 
revolution.</p> <p>The dream about Muhammad is the source of the 
controversy. It makes up two chapters of the book, "Mahound" and "Return
 to Jahilia." (Mahound is an archaic European name for the Prophet 
Muhammad; Jahilia is Rushdie's name for Mecca.) From the Islamic point 
of view, the most offensive passages are those referred to in the book's
 title, those having to do with the Satanic verses, a little-known but 
genuine issue in the history of Islam.</p> <p>Before looking at the 
Satanic Verses episode, however, an important point needs to be 
established about the Islamic faith, namely, that its irreducible core 
lies in acceptance of the Qur'an as the Word of God. At the very least, 
to be a Muslim means accepting on faith that God (or Allah, the same 
thing) sent His message to mankind via the angel Gabriel who passed it 
along to Muhammad; and that the Qur'an is inerrant. To doubt that the 
Qur'an is the exact message of God is to deny the validity of Muhammad's
 message and to imply that the entire Islamic faith is fraudulent at 
base. Therefore, such doubt is usually seen as an act of apostasy.</p> <p>The
 Satanic Verses episode concerns the fact that Muhammad was born and 
lived in Mecca, long a major center of the polytheistic Arabian 
religions. Indeed, the town's prosperity depended heavily on its role as
 a religious center, and the leaders of Muhammad's own tribe, Quraysh, 
depended especially on those shrines.</p> <p>The emphatic monotheism of 
Muhammad's message therefore posed a direct challenge to the existing 
order in general and to the leaders of Quraysh in particular. For this 
reason, Muhammad's initial teachings met with a poor response among the 
well-to-do in Mecca. The new faith did succeed in winning slaves, 
servants, non-tribal persons, and other riff-raff, but it made little 
progress among the burghers. Winning these over became a major concern 
of Muhammad's. It is in this context that the Satanic verses episode 
took place, in about 614 C.E., or one year after Muhammad began his 
career of public preaching.</p> <p>At-Tabari (d. 923), a historian and 
commentator on the Qur'an who provides much of our historical knowledge 
about Muhammad's life, transmits the account as follows: "Members of 
Quraysh suggested to Muhammad that he adopt a flexible attitude toward 
their idols, and they in return would adopt a more friendly attitude 
toward his preaching. 'If you make some mention of our goddesses, we 
would sit beside you [i.e., become Muslims]'." Soon after this offer, 
Muhammad recited the following verse of the Qur'an, which made reference
 to three of the most prominent Meccan goddesses:</p> <blockquote>Have you thought upon Lat and Uzza, And Manat, the third, the other?</blockquote> <p>At
 this point, according to the account in Tabari, Satan distorted the 
next words so that Muhammad accepted these three goddesses and confirmed
 the validity of their intercession between man and God:</p> <blockquote>These are the exalted birds, And their intercession is desired indeed.</blockquote> <p>Naturally,
 Quraysh was delighted by Muhammad's acceptance of the three goddesses. 
It meant that Islam was neither as monotheistic nor as radical as it had
 first appeared. The traditional religions would live on, at least in an
 attenuated form; the shrines of Mecca would retain their economic 
value.</p> <p>But then the angel Gabriel (the normal source of the 
Qur'an) came to Muhammad and revealed to him that the devil had deceived
 him into uttering the last two lines. To be precise, in Tabari's 
account, Gabriel revealed that "Satan caused to come upon his tongue" 
the verse about "the exalted birds." Gabriel abrogated these lines and 
replaced them with verses denouncing the cult of the three goddesses. 
The complete Qur'anic text on this issue reads as follows:</p> <blockquote>Have
 you thought upon Lat and Uzza, And Manat, the third, the other? Shall 
He have daughters and you sons? That would be a fine division! These are
 but [three] names you have dreamed of, you and your fathers. Allah 
vests no authority in them Even though guidance had come to them already
 from their Lord.</blockquote> <p>What had happened? Had Satan leaped on
 Muhammad's tongue? Or had the Prophet tried to ingratiate himself with 
the city leaders, then regretted the effort and recanted? Or, worse, had
 he tried to win their favor, been rebuffed, and changed the text 
accordingly?</p> <p>Obviously, this incident is one of the most delicate
 in Muhammad's mission. Here is the way that W. Montgomery Watt, the 
leading modern biographer of Muhammad, steers a neutral course in his 
summary of the incident:</p> <blockquote>Muhammad must have had 
sufficient success for the heads of Quraysh to take him seriously. 
Pressure was brought to bear on him to make some acknowledgement of the 
worship at the neighbouring shrines. He was at first inclined to do so, 
both in view of the material advantages such a course offered and 
because it looked as if it would speedily result in a successful end of 
his mission. Eventually, however, through Divine guidance as he 
believed, he saw that this would be a fatal compromise, and he gave up 
the prospect of improving his outward circumstances in order to follow 
the truth as he saw it.</blockquote> <p>The phrase "as he believed" is 
Watt's way to avoid judging the issue. In other words, this is the 
territory of faith where the historian dares not tread. But the novelist
 does. Rushdie is a skeptic, and he treats the incident as one of 
deceit.</p> <h3>III. The Title</h3> <p>In Rushdie's novel, the prophet 
spoke the false verses not because Satan put them in his mouth, but 
because he saw an opportunity to advance his cause. Later, Mahound 
"returns to the city as quickly as he can, to expunge the foul verses 
that reek of brimstone and sulphur, to strike them from the record for 
ever and ever." To cover his deception, Mahound adopts the notion, put 
forward by one of his followers, that the devil made him do it.</p> <p>But
 Rushdie's offense in this section goes beyond the charge that Muhammad 
weaved and bobbed as his interests changed; the real problem lies in the
 implication that the entire Qur'an derived not from God through 
Gabriel, but from Muhammad himself, who put the words in Gabriel's 
mouth.</p> <blockquote>Gibreel [Gabriel], hovering-watching from his 
highest camera angle, knows one small detail, just one tiny thing that's
 a bit of a problem here, namely that it was me both times, baba, me 
first and second also me. From my mouth, both the statement and the 
repudiation, verses and converses, universes and reverses, the whole 
thing, and we all know how my mouth got worked.</blockquote> <p>This 
last point ("and we all know how my mouth got worked") refers to 
Gibreel's being forced to say what he does by Mahound. If this is true, 
then the Qur'an is a human artifact and the Islamic faith is built on a 
deceit. There is nothing left.</p> <p>But is that what Rushdie has 
implied? The whole sequence, after all, is part of a dream; and the 
dreamer, Gibreel Farishta, is a man whose name means "Gabriel Angel" and
 who suffers from "paranoid delusions" of being the Archangel Gibreel. 
Surely this places the author at considerable distance from the story he
 tells. Further, other Muslims have written on Muhammad and the Qur'an 
in ways objectively more offensive to Islam than Rushdie, and they have 
been attacked far less. For example, Ali Dashti, an Iranian whose works 
were freely available after the Iranian revolution, wrote an analysis of
 Muhammad's mission which included such statements as: "The Lord who 
made observance of ancient Arab lunar time-reckoning compulsory 
everywhere and for ever must have been either a local Arabian god or the
 Prophet Muhammad."</p> <p>It is no wonder that Rushdie got negative 
reviews from Muslims, but why did Rushdie and his book so provoke the 
Muslims of England and South Africa, the Saudi authorities, mobs in 
Pakistan, and the Ayatollah Khomeini? Something about this book - other 
than its contents - had to arouse their ire.</p> <p>The clue may lie in 
the fact that almost no one who protested the book had even read 
excerpts of it, much less the entire novel. That they could get so 
excited about a book that they had not read indicates that the source of
 their anger lay in what they did know. And what did they know? That an 
author named Salman Rushdie, living in Great Britain, wrote a book 
called The Satanic Verses. In short, they were aware of little beyond 
the title.</p> <p>But the book's title has an impact when translated 
into Arabic that it does not have in English. Here is Rushdie's 
understanding on the matter:</p> <blockquote>Even the novel's title has 
been termed blasphemous; but the phrase is not mine. It comes from 
al-Tabari, one of the canonic Islamic sources. Tabari writes... [that] 
Muhammad then received verses which accepted the three favorite Meccan 
goddesses as intercessionary agents. Meccans were delighted. Later, the 
Archangel Gabriel told Muhammad that these had been "Satanic verses," 
falsely inspired by the Devil in disguise and they were removed from the
 Koran.</blockquote> <p>Rushdie's account is generally correct - but he 
makes one mistake. The exact term "Satanic verses" is not found in 
Tabari. Tabari says: "Satan threw [something] into his formulation, and 
these verses were revealed." Admittedly, this is close in spirit to 
"Satanic verses," but it is not the same. The term "Satanic verses" is 
an English one, devised by orientalists. When rendered into Arabic, the 
phrase becomes Al-Ayat ash-Shaytaniya, using a word for "verses" (ayat) 
which refers specifically to the verses of the Qur'an. Back-translated 
to English, therefore, the Arabic title would be "The Qur'an's Satanic 
Verses." And, with just a touch of imagination, that is easily rendered 
as "The Qur'anic Verses Were Written By Satan," or even, "The Qur'an Was
 Written By Satan" In other words, the book's title is not being taken 
(as it should be) to refer to a bit of Islamic arcana concerning phrases
 omitted from the Qur'an. It is being read to assert that the Qur'an 
itself was the work of the devil.</p> <p>Herein lies the most probable 
direct cause of the furor. By hearing the title in this way, Muslims 
found it unimaginably offensive.</p> <h3>IV. The Initial Uproar</h3> <p>The uproar over The Satanic Verses began within days of the book's official publication in Britain, on September 26, 1988.</p> <p>Indian
 Muslims learned about the book in mid-September from India Today, a 
bi-weekly magazine, which reviewed it, excerpted it, and interviewed the
 author. Presciently, the reviewer concluded that "The Satanic Verses is
 bound to trigger an avalanche of protests from the ramparts." And, 
indeed, Syed Shahbuddin, a member of the Indian parliament, not liking 
what he read in India Today, began a campaign to have the novel banned. 
He met with quick success, as the Finance Ministry prohibited the book 
on October fifth.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Muslims in Britain heard from India 
about the book and began to agitate against its distribution. At first 
they tried having it banned, without success; then they tried protest 
and international pressure. The initial burning of The Satanic Verses 
took place in Bolton (near Manchester) on December 2, in a ceremony that
 attracted a crowd of 7,000 Muslims but scant press attention. Another 
effort was made on January 14, in the heavily Muslim town of Bradford, 
the so-called capital of Islam in the United Kingdom. The Bradford 
effort succeeded, as television news showed the auto-da-fÃ©-the novel 
attached to a stake and set on fire-in loving, if horrified, detail.</p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td><p>Burning "The Satanic Verses" in Bradford, England.</p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>In
 reply, Rushdie published a statement that called the Prophet Muhammad 
"one of the great geniuses of world history," but noted that Islamic 
doctrine holds Muhammad to be human, and in no way perfect. He held that
 the novel is not "an antireligious novel. It is, however, an attempt to
 write about migration, its stresses and transformations."</p> <p>British
 Muslims also alerted the London embassies of Muslim states about the 
book and its contents. But weeks passed and the states barely responded.
 The only disturbances were in South Africa, where local Muslims 
demonstrated against Rushdie's attendance at an anti-apartheid 
conference, forcing him to cancel.</p> <p>All of this proved merely a 
warm-up for the round of violence that began in Islamabad, Pakistan, on 
February 12 and continued for a month. The events that day are clear, 
though their causes remain disputed. A crowd of some 10,000, took to the
 streets and marched to the American Cultural Center, where they shouted
 "American dogs" and "God is great" and set fires to the building. Five 
demonstrators died at the hands of the police as the crowd surged toward
 the building, and about a hundred were injured. A Pakistani guard at 
the American Center was shot by someone in the mob, making him the sixth
 casualty of the day. The next day, a rioter lost his life in Kashmir, 
India.</p> <p>The odd thing about these riots was that British property 
was not attacked, although the novel had been out for months in the 
United Kingdom, and Rushdie was living in London. This may have had to 
do with the forthcoming U.S. publication of The Satanic Verses, 
scheduled for February 22. Or the violence may have been directed toward
 those in the opposition who wanted to exploit the opportunity to attack
 Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto - and the United States makes a better 
symbol of protest than Great Britain. Indeed, this is the way the prime 
minister interpreted the riots. Similarly, Rushdie accused the leaders 
of the demonstration of exploiting religious slogans for political ends.</p> <h3>V. Khomeini's Move</h3> <p>In
 any event, The Satanic Verses had caused, or excused, substantial 
disturbances among Muslims in several parts of the world by the middle 
of February. The disturbances and loss of life had attracted great 
attention, but there was no real political issue for the West to face. 
It took the Ayatollah Khomeini, a man who does not play by the usual 
rules, to mount that challenge.</p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td><p>The Feb. 27, 1989, issue of "Time" featured Khomeini's edict.</p></td> </tr> </tbody></table>Accounts
 differ as to how Khomeini learned about Rushdie and The Satanic Verses.
 One report says he was watching the news on Iranian television, saw the
 rioting in Pakistan, and was much affected by the scene. Indeed, it is 
hard to imagine a sight that would call on Khomeini's sense of Muslim 
solidarity more than Muslims crying out "God is great" and then 
proceeding to die outside an American Cultural Center. A second account 
has him hearing about the rioting in Pakistan from a small transistor 
radio he takes with him on his constitutionals. The final version has 
him "shaken utterly" upon reading excerpts of The Satanic Verses 
(presumably in Persian or Arabic translation, as Khomeini knows no 
English); the name Mahound is said to have been especially enraging to 
him. <p>However it happened, on February 14, Khomeini took the single 
most important step of the entire incident when, in an address to the 
"world's Muslim community," he pronounced an Islamic legal judgment (a 
fatwa, comparable to a Jewish responsa). Declaring The Satanic Verses in
 opposition to Islam, he pronounced a sentence of death on both Rushdie 
and his publishers.</p> <blockquote>The author of The Satanic Verses 
book, which is against Islam, the Prophet, and the Qur'an, and all those
 involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are 
sentenced to death. I ask all Muslims to execute them wherever they find
 them.</blockquote> <p>Khomeini called on Muslims to act quickly against
 Rushdie and promised martyrdom to whoever carried out the sentence. The
 president of Iran, Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, characterized Khomeini's 
statement as "an irrevocable dictum."</p> <p>To make the task more 
attractive, the head of an Iranian charity organization, the 15th 
Khorbad [5th of June] Relief Agency, offered $1 million to a non-Iranian
 assassin and 200 million rials (almost $3 million at the inflated rate 
of exchange, but just $170,000 on the parallel market), to an Iranian. 
The next day, the religious leader of Rafsanjan (hometown of 'Ali Akbar 
Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian parliament) offered another 
200 million rials, as did a mullah in Kerman.</p> <p>Members of the 
Iranian parliament expressed their support for Khomeini and their 
"divine anger" at Rushdie. The Iranian ambassador to the Holy See 
announced that he would "kill Salman Rushdie with his own hands" if he 
could. The Islamic Revolution News Agency representative in Spain 
promised likewise (and found himself instantly expelled from the 
country).</p> <p>More important, a number of groups sponsored by the 
Iranian government declared their determination to get Rushdie. Mohsen 
Reza'i, leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guard Corps announced the 
readiness of his forces "to carry out the imam's decree." Interior 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Mohtashemi called on Hizbullah to carry out the 
execution and the leaders of the Lebanese Hizbullah quickly promised to 
do "all that's possible to have the honor" of carrying out Khomeini's 
sentence. Other Lebanese groups, including Amal, the Islamic Unification
 Movement, the Jihad Organization for the Liberation of Palestine, and 
the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine all promised likewise.
 In addition, Ahmad Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command announced its intention to join the effort. 
The Revolutionary Justice Organization, went further than the others and
 vowed to attack the British police, if necessary, on the way to an 
assault on Rushdie. Something of a rivalry developed between these 
groups: Who would get to Rushdie first?</p> <p>On the 17th, however, 
President Khamene'i announced that "the people might forgive him," if 
Rushdie repented. Accordingly, the next day, Rushdie did offer an 
apology, though a minimal one.</p> <blockquote>As author of The Satanic 
Verses, I recognize that Muslims in many parts of the world are 
genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel. I profoundly regret
 the distress that the publication had occasioned to sincere followers 
of Islam. Living as we do in a world of many faiths, this experience has
 served to remind us that we must all be conscious of the sensibilities 
of others.</blockquote> <p>The apology concerned the effects of his writings, not the writings themselves, and so did not mollify his critics.</p> <p>Still,
 confusion in Iran followed, as a news agency report suggested that the 
apology, "though far too short of a repentance, is generally seen as 
sufficient enough to warrant his pardon by the masses in Iran and 
elsewhere in the world." Then the ayatollah weighed in, on February 19, 
with an absolute rejection of Rushdie's statement, and, indeed, of any 
act of contrition on his part. Khomeini denied foreign reports that 
repentance would lift the "execution order" against Rushdie.</p> <blockquote>Even
 if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man of [our] time,
 it is incumbent on every Muslim to employ everything he has, his life 
and his wealth, to send him to hell. ... If a non-Muslim becomes aware 
of his whereabouts and has the ability to execute him quicker than 
Muslims, it is incumbent on Muslims to pay a reward or a fee in return 
for this action.</blockquote> <h3>VI. Khomeini's Motives</h3> <p>Why did
 Ayatollah Khomeini turn The Satanic Verses into an international 
incident? Curiously, critics and supporters of the ayatollah have almost
 diametrically opposed explanations.</p> <p>Critics are nearly unanimous
 in seeing his act in political terms. Former Iranian President 
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr saw the event as "a political affair and not a 
religious one," and the leader of the main Iranian opposition group, 
Mas'ud Rajavi of the Mujahidin-e Khalq agreed.</p> <p>Some emphasized 
domestic political tensions in Iran. Amir Taheri saw The Satanic Verses 
as "an issue likely to stir the imagination of the poor and illiterate 
masses" in Iran. Harvey Morris saw it as a "revolutionary coup de 
thÃ©Ã¢tre" intended to replace the Iraq-Iran war as a focus of national 
unity. Others saw it mostly in terms of foreign policy. Youssef M. 
Ibrahim explained it as Khomeini's bid "to reassert his role as 
spokesman and protector of Islamic causes." William Waldegrave of the 
British Foreign Office blamed the incident on "radical elements in Iran,
 which do not want their country to have normal relations with the West 
and the Gulf states."</p> <p>Supporters of the ayatollah, on the other 
hand, see his move very differently, primarily as a religious response. 
The top Iranian diplomat in Cyprus told a local audience that "the 
verdict issued by the Iranian leader is a purely religious one and based
 on the religious considerations." The chargÃ© d'affaires in London 
stated unequivocally that Khomeini saw the punishment of Rushdie as 
"much more important than relations between two countries."</p> <p>Which
 side is correct? Prima facie, there is strong evidence to accept the 
religious interpretation. First, there is the emotional side - a 
blasphemous parody of the Prophet, the evident courage of Muslims in 
England, the martyrdom of Muslims in Pakistan. In combination, these are
 likely to have exerted a powerful effect on the aged Iranian leader.</p> <p>Second,
 the Muslims in India, Great Britain, and Pakistan who took to the 
streets before Khomeini spoke showed the depths of Muslim outrage. They 
had no connection to the struggles of Iranian political life.</p> <p>Third,
 there are much more direct ways for Khomeini, the autocratic leader of 
Iran, to shut down relations with the West. He rules without rival; had 
he decided to stop the improving ties, he could simply have decreed so. A
 politician in his position of authority need not take so unusual a step
 as placing a bounty on a novelist's head.</p> <p>Fourth, there is a 
persistent tendency not to take Khomeini's assertions at face value. 
This happened in 1978, as Iranians and others tried to foresee what kind
 of government he would impose in Iran. The evidence was all there, in 
the form of his writings over many years, but these tended to be ignored
 in favor of a more conventional interpretation of his goals. The 
insistence on a political explanation for the Rushdie fatwa risks 
falling into this same trap.</p> <p>Finally, the attack on Rushdie is 
consistent with other actions by the ayatollah, two of which deserve 
mention. He took nearly the same step 47 years earlier, when he was yet 
an obscure mullah. In 1942 he wrote The Discovery of Secrets, a polemic 
directed against Ahmad Kasravi, a prominent writer whose anti-clerical 
views had gained a significant following in Iran. Khomeini pronounced 
Kasravi mahdurr ad-damm (forfeit blood), thus permitting a Muslim to 
execute him. His book was read by Mohammed Nawab-Safavi, who went on to 
found a terrorist group, the Fedayin-e Islam, and this group made 
Kasravi its first target. Inspired by the Khomeini tract, Sayyed Husayn 
Emami and three others attacked Kasravi with knives, murdering him. 
Though Khomeini's response to the execution is not on record, his close 
friend, Sheikh Sadeq Khalkhali called day on which it took place "the 
most beautiful day in my life."</p> <p>Much more recently, Khomeini 
inflicted severe punishments on the producers of a Tehran Radio program 
called "Model for the Muslim Woman" for airing on January 28, 1989 what 
he called "an un-Islamic interview." A woman on the program had 
explained that she did not consider the daughter of the Prophet 
Muhammad, Fatima, to be a suitable model for herself; she preferred a 
more up-to-date exemplar - the heroine of a Japanese soap opera. 
Outraged, the ayatollah sent a letter to the director of Iranian 
broadcasting, telling him that if the insult was deliberate, the 
offending parties will "undoubtedly" be condemned to death. Three days 
later, the court sentenced one of the producers to five years in jail, 
two others to four years each and 50 lashes. And the court made clear 
that this relative leniency was due to an "absence of malicious intent" 
on their part; otherwise, all of them would have been sentenced to 
death.</p> <p>Those (such as George Black) who argue that Khomeini "has 
used Rushdie as a target of convenience," are wrong. The answer is very 
clear (in the words of The New Republic): "The Ayatollah does not want 
to use Rushdie; he wants to kill him. We must respect the man's 
sincerity."</p> <h3>VII. Defending Islam</h3> <p>Nevertheless, a 
question remains about the ayatollah's motivation: why did he make The 
Satanic Verses a centerpiece of Iran's post-war diplomacy? Granted the 
offensiveness of the (literally interpreted) text, the offensiveness of 
the (misunderstood) title, and Khomeini's religious extremism, it is 
still not clear why this book should be made the Iranian government's 
top priority. The answer lies in the strange vision of history held by 
Khomeini and other fundamentalist Muslims.</p> <p>Their view is based on
 a syllogism: Muslims were once strong, but are now weak. When Muslims 
were strong, they lived fully by the precepts of their faith, but now 
they do not. Therefore, Muslims are weak because they do not live up to 
the requirements of Islam. Were they to do so, they would regain the 
strength of centuries past. Khomeini's first goal, then, is to get 
Muslims to live fully by the law of Islam, the Shari'a. The just 
society, one where Muslims live in strict adherence to the Qur'an and 
the laws of Islam, is also the one which allows Muslims to achieve their
 natural strength.</p> <p>But there is one great obstacle to achieving 
this: the seductive culture of the West, which has been drawing Muslims 
away from the exact adherence to their faith for two centuries. 
Therefore, Muslims must engage in a battle against Western civilization.
 And a battle this is, for the West is not a passive purveyor of 
culture, but actively thrusts it on vulnerable Muslims. The West does so
 because it benefits by weakening Muslims; this allows it to plunder 
Muslim lands and hire the believers as cheap labor. 'Ali Akbar Hashemi 
Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian parliament, explained the deep 
historical roots of the effort:</p> <blockquote>From the day the Western
 colonialists harbored the intention of colonising the Islamic countries
 - or to be more precise, to demolish and create havoc in the Islamic 
world - they sensed that they must deal with something called Islam. 
They realized that as long as Islam is in force, their path will be a 
difficult one, or may be virtually closed off.<p>Whoever is familiar 
with the history of colonialism and the Islamic world knows that 
whenever they wanted to get a foothold in a place, the first thing they 
did in order to clear their paths - whether overtly or covertly - was to
 undermine the people's genuine Islamic morals.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of 
course, the imperialists could not entirely do away with Islam, so they 
did the next best thing, which was to emasculate the religion, reducing 
the faith to empty ceremonies devoid of real content. By 1978, 
ceremonial Islam (or "American-style Islam") prevailed at the state 
level everywhere in the world. But then, Rafsanjani continues, "with the
 advent of the Islamic Revolution, pure Islam entered the scene, and all
 they had done became undone." The Iranians threatened to lead all 
Muslims (and other oppressed peoples) against the hegemony of the great 
powers, the United States and the U.S.S.R. especially.</p> <p>Seeing the
 danger Iran posed, the powers fought back. The White House and Kremlin 
feared that the explosive energy in Iran would destroy what the Iranians
 call global arrogance. "All the West's plots," explains President 
Khamene'i, "are aimed at stopping Islam and the revolution from becoming
 a world model." The Iranians have to engage in combat with all they 
have.</p> <p>The war between Islam and "international blasphemy" has 
taken two main forms. First, the great powers put their agent, the Iraqi
 president, Saddam Hussein, up to a war which he obediently carried out.
 But military aggression failed against the hard rock of Islamic fervor.
 "After ten years," explains Mohtashemi, "the world gave up the hope of 
fighting Islam within Iran through military conflict."</p> <p>Stumped, 
the foes of Islam had to find a second battlefront against Islam. The 
Western governments "summoned all their devilish experts and mercenaries
 to draw up anew a strategy against Islam." At the conclusion of all 
these efforts, global arrogance hit on a plan-warfare conducted (again) 
on the level of culture. The effort, according to a commentary on Radio 
Tehran, has two steps. First, "the aim is to weaken the Islamic faith 
among Muslims, thereby secularizing Muslims societies; this is then 
followed by an expansion of [Western] influence and the ultimate 
plundering of those societies' vital resources."</p> <p>The Iranian 
authorities detailed a whole series of steps behind The Satanic Verses. 
Not for a minute did they believe the book had been written by a single 
author pursuing the whimsies of his own imagination. According to 
Rafsanjani, when Muslims read this book, "they will not see a mad Indian
 behind it; they will see Britain, Germany, France, and the United 
States." In his view, the Western intelligence services knew what they 
were doing when they picked Rushdie to be the ostensible author. They 
picked</p> <blockquote>a person who seemingly comes from India and who 
apparently is separate from the Western world and who has a misleading 
name [i.e., a Muslim name]. ... All these advance royalties were given 
to that person. One can see that they appointed guards for him in 
advance because they what they were doing. ... All this tells us of an 
organized and planned effort. It is not an ordinary work.... I believe 
there has not previously been such a well-planned act as this.</blockquote> <p>The
 effort required five years and $1.5 million. British intelligence even 
managed to have The Satanic Verses introduced as "the book of the year" 
in Britain. Had Muslims not protested, the book would have been made 
into a film.</p> <p>But how, an outsider might ask, can this novel hurt 
Muslims? By making their faith and their traditions less honorable 
through distortion and ridicule. It hurts to be "ridiculed by world 
arrogance," and the pain turns Muslims against Islam. Fortunately, 
Muslims understood what was brewing, and they showed "with their rage" 
an intent to neutralize the plot. Their steadfastness stopped the 
cultural campaign in its tracks. The Iranian leadership portrayed the 
Rushdie incident as a major reassertion of Islam, and therefore a 
turning point in the fortunes of the faith. For example, a newspaper 
editorial explained how the Turkish government had been taking quiet but
 effective steps toward "ridding Turkey of Islam." But the shock of The 
Satanic Verses awakened the true Muslims of Turkey to the dangers in 
their midst.</p> <p>Note that the Iranian leaders speak of "the West," 
or "global arrogance," for they do not believe that British intelligence
 acted alone in putting Rushdie up to the job; as ever, it worked 
hand-in-glove with its big brother, the United States. An Iranian 
government statement referred to the book as a "provocative American 
deed" and called Rushdie "an inferior CIA agent." As the interior 
minister, Mohtashemi, put it, "the book's author is in England, but the 
real supporter is the United States."</p> <p>The irony of identifying 
Rushdie with the American government was not lost on saner voices. 
Rushdie, after all, is a Muslim of Indian origins who lives in England 
and holds a British passport. Further, he is widely known as a "man of 
the left," who almost always opposes the policies of the U.S. 
government. How, then, did Rushdie and the United States become 
intertwined in the minds of fundamentalist Muslims? Because 
Anti-Westernism has a way of turning into anti-Americanism. Britain may 
have been the imperial overlord, but now it is nearly defanged; the 
military threat is virtually gone. Too, American culture has a symbolic 
role. Whether Rushdie is living in London or New York City is a minor 
detail to fundamentalist Muslims; the point is that the United States 
presents the main threat, for it is the leader of the Western world, 
that lascivious place where it is acceptable, even encouraged, to attack
 the Prophet and the Qur'an.</p> <h3>VIII. Muslim Responses</h3> <p>One 
might have expected the world to have dismissed the twisted edict that 
came from Khomeini as madness, root and branch. But one would have been 
wrong.</p> <p>On the official level, to be sure, the Iranians found 
little support. Only the Libyan government publicly stood by the 
ayatollah and his edict. The Kuwaiti government announced that it shared
 an "identical stance" with Tehran on the matter of The Satanic Verses, 
but it carefully avoided stating equal agreement on its author.</p> <p>At
 the popular level, however, anti-Rushdie violence showed support for 
Khomeini. In the Indian subcontinent violent demonstrations continued 
for a month. The largest number of deaths in a single incident occurred 
on February 24th, when rioting in Rushdie's home town of Bombay turned 
into a three-hour battle between the police and fundamentalist Muslims. 
The rioters burned cars, buses, and even a small police station. In 
answer, the police killed twelve persons, detained 500, and arrested 
800. On March 4, thousands of demonstrators ransacked part of the 
Karachi airport in protest against the Rushdie novel, smashing doors and
 looting the VIP lounge; this was their way of welcoming home from Iran 
the pro-Khomeini Shi'i leaders, Sajid 'Ali Naqvi. Naturally, the 
Iranians gloried in these demonstrations, calling them a "manifestation 
of Muslim power throughout the world" and "symptoms of this very 
majesty."</p> <p>Confronted with such emotion, many leaders in Muslim 
countries sought to avoid the whole issue. They did not refer to it in 
public and they instructed their media to cover the controversy without 
comment. "I don't care to comment about the action of the Government of 
Iran myself," was King Hussein of Jordan's reply to a question on the 
subject. "Turkey is not a party to the arguments concerning the book," 
came the word from Ankara.</p> <p>Although the authorities in all Muslim
 countries acknowledged the alleged blasphemy of The Satanic Verses, 
some did oppose Khomeini's edict. Not surprisingly, the Iraqi government
 felt no qualms about attacking it. President Saddam Hussein observed 
that "murder and incitement to murder is more harmful to Islam and 
Muslim than Salman Rushdie's tendentious and sinister book." The 
Egyptian foreign minister, 'Ismat 'Abd al-Majid, blamed Khomeini for 
creating the problem, and held that "Khomeini had no right to sentence 
Rushdie to death."</p> <p>Several individual voices from the Arab 
countries also criticized Khomeini. In an act of singular bravery, 
Naguib Mahfouz, winner of the 1988 Nobel Prize in literature, called 
Khomeini's threat an act of "intellectual terrorism." Understandably, 
Muslims resident in the West felt freest to speak out. The chairman of 
the Imams and Mosque Council in Britain, Zaka Badawi, offered his own 
house as an asylum to Salman Rushdie.</p> <p>From the vantage point of 
governments wishing to stay out of the picture, the easiest, least 
worrisome step was to ban the book and say no more. Indeed, few 
non-Western governments containing substantial Muslim populations 
resisted Saudi and Iranian pressure to ban The Satanic Verses, and many 
banned all books by Viking-Penguin. Even in Israel, the Ministry of 
Religious Affairs requested that the Keter publishing house drop its 
plans for a Hebrew translation.</p> <p>The most notable exception to 
this pattern was Turkey, where the authorities hold an almost-religious 
devotion to the secularist principles laid down sixty years ago by 
AtatÃ¼rk. Despite an overwhelmingly Muslim population, a substantial 
fundamentalist movement, and active Iranian pressure (the Iranian consul
 in Erzurum distributed copies of the Khomeini fatwa against Rushdie to 
religious leaders throughout eastern Anatolia), Ankara stuck firmly, if 
quietly and unhappily, to freedom of expression. It was a no-win 
situation. To take a stand against the book would damage the country's 
European credentials and reduce its chances of being accepted into the 
European Economic Community; not to take a stand would upset the many 
fundamentalist Muslims in Turkey.</p> <p>Also, notwithstanding a 
long-standing Muslim rebellion in the Philippines, the government in 
Manila indicated it could not ban the book, for this would traverse 
constitutional guarantees of free speech.</p> <h3>IX. Non-Muslim Responses</h3> <p>Among
 non-Muslims, the Khomeini edict prompted responses in three stages. 
First, the week after February 14 was characterized by retreat and 
confusion. Publishers delayed or cancelled editions of the book, 
politicians temporized, even Rushdie apologized. Then, when it became 
clear that such concessions would win nothing in return from Khomeini, 
public opinion hardened and leaders adopted a more defiant stand, 
lasting from about February 20 to February 28. With the start of March a
 second round of retreats began, as writers, politicians, and religious 
figures turned against Rushdie. The controversy fell from sight in 
mid-March.</p> <p>The governments of the West, who after all had both 
the responsibility and the means for protecting the rights of those 
threatened by Khomeini, responded in particularly timorous fashion. The 
British prime minister and the leader of the opposition, Neil Kinnock, 
kept silent about the ayatollah's threat for a full week. The 
newly-installed Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, could muster no 
more condemnation than to call the death threat "regrettable." The 
Canadian government temporarily banned imports of The Satanic Verses; 
worse, the government finessed the freedom-of-speech issue by relegating
 the decision to Revenue Canada, a tax agency. Bonn called the incident a
 "strain on German-Iranian relations." But it was the Japanese 
government that came out with the most spineless formulation of all: 
"encouraging murder," it intoned, "is not something to be praised."</p> <p>Several
 governments - including the British, French and Soviet - sought a way 
out of the diplomatic impasse by noting that Khomeini's edict was issued
 not by the Iranian government but by the "spiritual leader" of the 
Islamic Revolution. Not only had ten years of experience shown this 
distinction to be utterly spurious, but the entire rank and file of the 
Iranian government fell all over themselves to align with Khomeini's 
action.</p> <p>Moscow, which has a doctrinal antipathy in roughly equal 
measure for both freedom of speech and respect for religion, emerged 
looking rather well from the confrontation. Most impressive were the 
analyses offered in the Soviet media. In its Persian language broadcast,
 the Radio Peace and Progress said the call from Tehran for Rushdie's 
execution</p> <blockquote>is a source of great regret because it has 
eliminated the hopes... in the Soviet Union that the political crisis in
 relation to the said novel would die down.... Resorting to terror and 
threats in this way will have no other outcome for Iran but the 
exacerbation of international crises with dangerous consequences for 
Iran itself.</blockquote> <p>Another analysis on the station assessed 
blame even more bluntly: "Tehran's extremist reaction to The Satanic 
Verses has led to the current diplomatic war between Iran and the West."
 Similarly, Pravda referred to demonstrators supporting Khomeini as 
"Muslim fanatics."</p> <p>Predictably, international organizations 
wanted nothing to do with the Rushdie issue, which polarized emotions 
and challenged the comfortable assumptions of a single order which 
underlie such institutions. Western efforts to condemn Khomeini at the 
United Nations Commission on Human Rights got nowhere, as the Muslim 
states made it clear they would oppose such efforts.</p> <p>Finally, on 
February 20, the foreign ministers of the Common Market agreed on a 
strong statement about Rushdie and his publishers:</p> <blockquote>The 
Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the 12 member states of the European 
Community, meeting in Brussels, discussed the Iranian threats and 
incitements to murder against novelist Salman Rushdie and his 
publishers, now repeated despite the apology made by the author.<p>The 
ministers view those threats with the gravest concern. They condemn this
 incitement to murder as an unacceptable violation of the most 
elementary principles and obligations that govern relations among 
sovereign states....</p> <p>The ministers of the 12 decided to 
simultaneously recall their Heads of Mission in Tehran for consultations
 and to suspend exchanges of high-level official visits.</p> </blockquote> <p>But
 though the British government withdrew all its personnel from Tehran 
and demanded that all the Iranian representatives leave London, it did 
not break diplomatic relations, insisting instead on what it called 
"reciprocity at zero." Observers knew of no precedent for the 
maintenance of diplomatic relations without any personnel; the British 
move was understood as a way of expressing strong displeasure and regret
 simultaneously - that is, normal relations could be built back up just 
as soon as the edict was retracted. But the Iranians, far from 
retracting, took the next step in the diplomatic dance; on February 28 
the Majlis (parliament) passed a bill that stipulated a complete break 
on March 7 unless the British government declared "its opposition to the
 unprincipled stands against the world of Islam, the Islamic Republic of
 Iran, and the contents of the anti-Islamic book, The Satanic Verses."</p> <p>Prodded
 by feelers from "pragmatists" in Tehran, British leaders did what they 
could to satisfy Tehran. On March 2, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe
 went on the BBC World Service to show foreign listeners that the 
government wished to distance itself from Rushdie.</p> <blockquote>We 
understand that the book itself has been found deeply offensive by 
people of the Muslim faith. It is a book that is offensive in many other
 ways as well. We can understand why it could be criticized. The British
 Government, the British people, do not have any affection for the book.
 The book is extremely critical, rude about us. It compares Britain with
 Hitler's Germany. We do not like that any more than the people of the 
Muslim faith like the attacks on their faith contained in the book. So 
we are not cosponsoring the book. What we are sponsoring is the right of
 people to speak freely, to publish freely.</blockquote> <p>Two days later, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made similar remarks.</p> <p>The
 Iranians acknowledged these gestures but demanded practical measures as
 well, such as the legal prosecution of the writer, confiscation of 
copies of The Satanic Verses, and injunction against further publication
 of the book. These steps the British authorities did not even consider 
undertaking; so, as threatened, Tehran broke relations on March 7. Its 
statement, a product of its conspiracy view, included some of the most 
unusual language and reasoning to be found anywhere in international 
diplomacy:</p> <p>The statement noted that, "in the past two centuries 
Britain has been in the frontline of plots and treachery against Islam 
and Muslims," and it went on to provide details on perfidious Albion in 
Palestine, Iraq, Pakistan, and elsewhere. It alleged that London has 
suffered severe reverses at the hands of Islamic movements, and so it 
has dropped the old military tactics and adopted more sophisticated 
political and cultural ones-and this is what led the British to sponsor 
The Satanic Verses. But the Islamic Republic would not abide this plot, 
and therefore broke off relations with the United Kingdom. A Tehran 
daily suggested that the break could easily last "at least a decade."</p> <p>In
 retaliation, the British government closed down the Iranian consulate 
in Hong Kong and expelled nine Iranians resident in the United Kingdom. 
The Foreign Office also urged British nationals to stay away from 
Lebanon. Further, the foreign secretary, using his strongest language 
since the controversy began, called the Iranian government a "deplorable
 regime" and (for the first time) condemned its recent "mass 
exterminations."</p> <p>Two unusual features characterized these 
diplomatic moves. First, both the British and the Iranian governments 
could count on exceptionally wide domestic support for their actions, 
including nearly unanimous parliamentary backing. Second, for all the 
animosity between the two states, neither side made a single move to 
interfere with existing trade relations. The British continued to 
purchase Iranian crude oil, the Iranians continued to purchase a wide 
array of British goods, and such official British services as the Export
 Credits Guarantee Department (which provides short-term cover for 
British exports) witnessed a "fairly busy, regular market."</p> <p>The 
foreign ministers of the forty-four states belonging to the Organization
 of the Islamic Conference met on March 13-16, 1989 in Riyadh and 
adopted the Saudi position, not the Iranian one, on Rushdie:</p> <blockquote>The
 conference declared that blasphemy cannot be justified on the basis of 
freedom of expression and opinion. The conference strongly condemned the
 book The Satanic Verses, whose author is regarded as a heretic. It 
appeals to all members of society to impose a ban on the book and to 
take the necessary legislation to insure the protection of the religious
 beliefs of others.</blockquote> <p>A British official responded a day 
later by attempting, not to explain that freedom of speech did indeed 
encompass blasphemy, but to disassociate his government from Rushdie. 
Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave went on the BBC's Arabic 
Service to explain:</p> <blockquote>I would like to put on record that 
the British Government well recognizes the hurt and distress that this 
book has caused, and we want to emphasize that because it was published 
in Britain, the British Government had nothing to do with and is not 
associated with it in any way. ... What is surely the best way forward 
is to say that the book is offensive to Islam, that Islam is far 
stronger than a book by a writer of this kind.</blockquote> <p>Radio 
Tehran read this statement as a British acknowledgment that the book 
includes blasphemous passages, and counted this admission as a major 
step forward from the Howe and Thatcher statements. It made, however, no
 concessions in return.</p> <p>Exactly one month after the decision to 
withdraw top diplomats of the EEC from Iran, the foreign ministers met 
again and decided, under Greek, Irish, and Italian pressure, to send 
them back. Khomeini described the Europeans as returning in "shame, 
abjectness, and disgrace, regretting their deed." Lamely, the French 
Foreign Ministry called this an "exaggeration."</p> <h3>X. Conclusion</h3> <p>'Ali
 Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian parliament, observed 
that the Rushdie affair is "one of the rarest and strangest events in 
history," and he is right. Several aspects of the Rushdie incident are 
unprecedented.</p> <p>Never has a book been so much the heart of an 
international crisis. Never have so many governments waited so anxiously
 for the peaceable moves of a private writer. The absurdity of the 
situation was caught by a cartoon in Le Monde which showed Rushdie at 
his typewriter, surrounded by fifteen harried bobbies keeping an eye on 
him; one of the policemen barks into the walkie-talkie, "Close the 
airports!! He wants to write volume two!!!"</p> <p>Similarly, never 
before has there been a human rights case that crossed boundaries in 
this fashion. "Other despots have banned books and outlawed thoughts," 
observed Hendrik Hertzberg. "What is unique and unprecedented about 
Khomeini is the global ambition, and the threatened global reach, of his
 censorship-by-threat. He has created the first planetary civil 
liberties case. This is his distinctive contribution to the history of 
tyranny." And the West's reaction, when confronted by the first 
planetary civil liberties case, was to back down as far as it legally 
could.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> Bibliography: In addition to my 1990 book, <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/books/rushdie.php">The Rushdie Affair</a>, here are my articles on the Rushdie affair and its aftermath:</p> <ul class="rm-manual">
