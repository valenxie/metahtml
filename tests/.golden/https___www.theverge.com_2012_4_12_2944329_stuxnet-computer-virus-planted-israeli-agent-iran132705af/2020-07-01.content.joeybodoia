<p class="rm-manual">According to a new report, US intelligence 
officials are claiming that Israel hired Iranian dissidents to infect 
Iran's Natanz nuclear facility with the Stuxnet virus using USB thumb 
drives.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> Via <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/stuxnet-worm-reportedly-planted-by-iranian-double-agent-using-memory-stick.ars?comments=1#comments-bar">Ars Technica</a> | Source <a href="http://www.isssource.com/stuxnet-loaded-by-iran-double-agents/">ISSSource</a> </p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual">Cyberware</figcaption><p>Even before 
computer security researchers began prying it open, one of the more 
plausible theories on the origin of the infamous <a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/stuxnet">Stuxnet worm</a>
 claimed that the virus was planted within Iranian nuclear facilities by
 an Israeli agent using USB memory sticks. A new report from Richard 
Sale of <a href="http://www.isssource.com/stuxnet-loaded-by-iran-double-agents/">ISSSource</a>
 seems to support this theory, citing former and senior US intelligence 
officials who claim that Israel hired proxies to insure the infection of
 Iran's Natanz facility.</p>
<p>Since its discovery in 2010, Stuxnet has been billed as the most 
sophisticated computer virus ever created, a labyrinthine masterwork of 
code that burrowed into hundreds of thousands of systems using a 
record-shattering 20 zero-day security exploits. Its programming was so 
complex that it took researchers months to unravel the virus' true 
purpose as it lay dormant within computer systems around the world. 
Further investigation revealed that the virus had a specific list of 
targets, focusing specifically on SCADA (supervisory control and data 
acquisition) systems created by Siemens to monitor and control 
industrial processes. Stuxnet completed its mission after damaging 
centrifuges used for uranium enrichment in the Natanz facility, as <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet-the-most-menacing-malware-in-history.ars">Wired</a> reported last year.</p>
<p>The intelligence officials, who requested anonymity due to their 
proximity to investigations, believe the agents were recruited from 
Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), a group of Iranian dissidents with a sordid 
and violent history who have been allegedly responsible for targeted 
killings of Iranian nuclear scientists at the behest of the Israeli 
intelligence service, Mossad, according to the report. Rather than 
assume the virus would take root naturally, an agent was reportedly 
directed to load memory sticks containing the virus code on computer 
systems deep inside the Natanz facility. According to ISSSource, US 
officials said they suspect the virus was then unleashed into the 
systems by the user simply by clicking the executable's icon in Windows.</p>
