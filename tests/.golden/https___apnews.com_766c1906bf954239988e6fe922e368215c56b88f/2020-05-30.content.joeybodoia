<p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Monday responded to a tweet 
by U.S. President Donald Trump that hinted at another summit with North 
Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying it has no interest in giving Trump 
further meetings to brag about unless it gets something substantial in 
return.</p>
<p>The statement by Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan is the latest 
call by North Korea for U.S. concessions ahead of an end-of-year 
deadline set by Kim Jong Un for the Trump administration to offer 
mutually acceptable terms for a deal to salvage nuclear diplomacy.</p>
<p>Following a U.S. decision over the weekend to call off joint military
 exercises with South Korea to create space for diplomacy with the 
North, Trump in a tweet urged Kim Jong Un to “act quickly, get the deal 
done” and hinted at another summit between them, saying “See you soon!”</p>
<p>But Kim Kye Gwan reiterated his government’s stance that Washington 
must discard what North Korea sees as “hostile” policies to keep the 
negotiations alive.</p>
<p>“Three rounds of DPRK-U.S. summit meetings and talks were held since 
June last year, but no particular improvement has been achieved in the 
DPRK-U.S. relations ... the U.S. only seeks to earn time, pretending it 
has made progress in settling the issue of the Korean Peninsula,” he 
said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, 
referring to North Korea by the initials of its formal name, the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>“We are no longer interested in such talks that bring nothing to us. 
As we have got nothing in return, we will no longer gift the U.S. 
president with something he can boast of, but get compensation for the 
successes that President Trump is proud of as his administrative 
achievements.”</p>
<p>Kim Kye Gwan is a veteran diplomat who led the North Korean 
delegation at much of the now-dormant six-nation nuclear disarmament 
talks held in Beijing in 2003-2008.</p>
<p>His statement came hours after KCNA reported that Kim Jong Un 
supervised a parachuting drill by military sharpshooters and vowed to 
build an “invincible army,” displaying more defiance despite the 
decision by the U.S. and South Korea to shelve their drills.</p>
<p>It was North Korea’s second publicized military drill in three days. A
 report Saturday said Kim urged combat pilots to prepare against enemies
 “armed to the teeth” while attending a flight demonstration.</p>
<p>North Korea has been ramping up missile tests and other military 
demonstrations in recent months in an apparent pressure tactic over the 
talks.</p>
<p>Negotiations have faltered since a February summit between Kim and 
Trump in Vietnam which broke down after the U.S. rejected North Korean 
demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender 
of its nuclear capabilities.</p>
<p>Kim later issued his end-of-year deadline and has also said the North
 would seek a “new path” if the United States persists with sanctions 
and pressure.</p>
<p>Working-level talks last month in Sweden broke down over what the 
North Koreans described as the Americans’ “old stance and attitude.”</p>
<p>North Korea last week said the United States has proposed a 
resumption of negotiations in December. Kim Myong Gil, who was the 
North’s main negotiator for the Stockholm talks, didn’t clearly say 
whether the North would accept the supposed U.S. offer and said the 
country has no interest in talks if they are aimed at buying time 
without discussing solutions.</p>
<p>He said North Korea isn’t willing to make a deal over “matters of 
secondary importance,” such as possible U.S. offers to formally declare 
an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted by a cease-fire, not a
 peace treaty, or establish a liaison office between the countries.</p>
<p>At an Asian defense ministers’ conference in Bangkok on Sunday, U.S. 
Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the United States has indefinitely 
postponed a joint military exercise with South Korea in an “act of 
goodwill” toward North Korea.</p>
