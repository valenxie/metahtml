<h1 class="rm-manual"> Rodman’s Revelations</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">After his controversial trips to North Korea caused
 an international firestorm, the NBA Hall of Famer mostly shunned the 
media. Now Dennis Rodman is ready to talk</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Written by <a href="https://dujour.com/contributors/lindsay-silberman/">Lindsay Silberman</a></p>
<p class="rm-manual">Photographed by Alex John Beck</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Produced by Jason Binn</p>
<p>He’s early. It’s just after 10 a.m. at the Turnberry Isle Miami in 
Aventura, Florida, and in walks Dennis Rodman—all six feet seven inches 
of him, wearing a tattered baseball cap emblazoned with “Cheetah 
Gentlemen’s Club,” a wrinkled cotton T-shirt, black nylon track pants 
and a pair of impossibly large boat shoes with laces tied in haphazard 
knots. The oversized women’s sunglasses he wears will remain secured to 
his face for the duration of the interview.</p>
<p>Rodman, 52, is initially standoffish. “Let’s make this quick,” he 
says quietly. But once he starts talking, he opens up and over the next 
two hours delivers as promised, with a frank conversation about North 
Korea, the nation that has consumed his life for the past 15 months. For
 the uninitiated, the story goes like this: As part of a documentary 
series they were creating, producers at the media company Vice gained 
access to the Communist country—which is off-limits to Americans—by 
catering to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s obsession with the Chicago
 Bulls. The producers reached out to Rodman, inviting him to North Korea
 for an exhibition basketball game alongside three members of the Harlem
 Globetrotters. Rodman agreed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vice.com/read/north-korea-has-a-friend-in-dennis-rodman">Rodman’s first trip</a>
 to North Korea took place in February 2013. Since then, he says he’s 
visited six times. He calls Kim a “friend for life,” and as a result has
 been condemned by some in America as a traitor and a dupe. But however 
you judge him, the provocative basketball player is now a potential 
source of information about a country that is inaccessible to most of 
the world. From the outside looking in, we see only Kim Jong-un’s 
appalling human-rights record and his country’s notorious famines, state
 executions and other abuses—but Rodman has a different perspective.</p>
<p>DuJour: Starting from the very beginning—can you talk about what it was like the first time you set foot in the country?</p>
<p>Dennis Rodman: It’s nothing like you’ve seen over here. Not even 
close. It’s funny, because when I first went there it was so…Communist. 
Dry and dreary and like, I don’t know. Everything is so dead. Like The 
Walking Dead. But the third time I went there, wow. [Pyongyang] changed a
 lot. New buildings were popping up and [Kim] is building all these new 
condos and hotels. He built the largest water park in the world, a ski 
resort and this big bowling alley. He’s doing everything for these 
people. You could go bowl for a quarter all day or go swimming all day 
for like 50 cents.</p>
<p>DJ: So in your view he’s “for the people,” yet he’s almost 
universally regarded as a hostile dictator. How do you reconcile that?</p>
<p>DR: He’s for the people. I wish they had somebody that could actually
 come back with me. You’ve got a five-foot-one president in a small 
country that scares the shit out of people on this earth. And people 
here want to know, “Is he this tyrant? Does he kill people?” I’ve been 
around him and his compound, I’ve been to his vacation spots. If I would
 have seen something negative about him, I probably would have come back
 and said so.</p>
<p>DJ: I realize you’re not a foreign-policy expert, but when you’re 
visiting, don’t you think they’re only showing you the part that they 
want to show you?</p>
<p>DR: I know the media very well. It can work against you, it can work 
for you. And for me, I’ve been dealing with negative publicity all my 
damn life. But when it comes to politics, I never got involved in that 
shit.</p>
<p>DJ: It’s hard to shock Dennis Rodman. But did that happen at any time in your trips?</p>
<p>DR: It was only one thing. When I walked into that stadium [for the 
first game], I sat down, and this little guy walks in. The Harlem 
Globetrotters were playing and I was sitting on the bench, and he sits 
right beside me. Seriously, I didn’t know who this f-ker was! People 
were sitting there kissing his hand and crying and giving their babies 
to him. I couldn’t believe these people—men and women sitting there 
crying for 25 minutes—and this kid’s like yay tall! They had this little
 chant and all the people were on their knees bowing down to this guy. 
That’s what shocked me right there. I’ve been around—I’ve seen a lot of 
leaders—but not like that. That’s how I actually met Kim.</p>
<p>The other thing I was really shocked at was when I went to see the 
grandfather and the father in the mausoleum. It’s about five times 
bigger than Aventura Mall. The whole thing, I swear to God, it’s five 
miles in diameter. You cannot run, you cannot walk, you have to get in 
this escalator. The grandfather is in the middle of the room with all 
his pictures and stuff, and he’s frozen. That’s a true story! You can’t 
never bow in front of his head, you have to go around him and bow. I’m 
like, “Damn! This shit looks real!” They said yeah, he’s frozen forever.
 The father’s frozen, same thing. Each room is that big and the room 
after that is for [Kim]. That’s what tripped me out. 150,000 people go 
in a day. They have to wear black suits. You see them crying the whole 
time. That’s what trips me out about the country. They all cry.</p>
<p>The Kim-Il-Sung Mausoleum</p>
<p>DJ: How would you describe Kim Jong-un’s personality?</p>
<p>DR: When he’s around his people, he’s just like anybody else. He 
jokes and loves playing basketball, table tennis, pool. They love 
American ’80s music. They do karaoke to it. He has this 13-piece girls 
band with violins. He gets a mic and they play the whole time. He loves 
the Doors and Jimi Hendrix. Oldies. When I first went, the live band 
only played two songs for four hours: the theme songs from Rocky and 
Dallas.</p>
<p>DJ: Is he image conscious?</p>
<p>DR: His wife is. They’ve been married two years. She don’t dress like
 a typical [North] Korean. She likes Gucci, Versace. She dressed really 
cool. And Kim dressed pretty much in black, gray, brown. He made me two 
suits. They come right there and make a suit for you in two hours.</p>
<p>DJ: What have your interactions been like with his family?</p>
<p>DR: I’ve been around his whole family; I’ve held his baby. No one’s 
ever held his baby before but me. I got pictures of me holding his 
infant. I gave [his daughter] a little Rodman jersey, we took pictures 
of it. Me, him and her and his wife. I have a lot of pictures of that in
 my safe-deposit box.</p>
<p>DJ: How did the second exhibition game, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/08/dennis-rodman-happy-birthday_n_4560359.html">on his birthday</a>, come about?</p>
<p>DR: He was making fun of the Harlem Globetrotters, saying he didn’t 
want a circus the next time. We were on this big-ass yacht—it’s like a 
Lady Moura, a 400-foot yacht, like a cruise ship. And we were having 
dinner and I said, “I should throw a basketball game here. Just me and 
I’ll bring a lot of athletes. When is your birthday?” And he said 
January 8, so I said, “Let’s do it on your birthday.” And he jumped up 
in the air, started clapping and telling everybody, “Oh my God! He’s 
throwing a basketball game for me!”</p>
<p>DJ: So you put a group together of seven retired NBA players and brought them over. Afterward, some of the players say <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1939556-ex-nba-player-cliff-robinson-on-north-korea-trip-what-are-we-doing-here">they were misled</a> about the trip. They thought they were going to play for charity. Is that true?</p>
<p>DR: Bullshit. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. They knew.</p>
<p>DJ: And they got paid…</p>
<p>DR: Who paid ’em? I paid ’em! I paid them before they went over there.</p>
<p>DJ: Roughly how much?</p>
<p>DR: $30,000 to $35,000 each.</p>
<p>DJ: So you said, “It’s Kim Jong-un’s birthday, I’ll give you $35,000 
for three days, do you want to come?” And they all said yes?</p>
<p>DR: Yeah. They didn’t realize we had a camera rolling 24-7 [for a 
BBC-produced documentary]. [Filming] them saying, “Oh, I love North 
Korea!”</p>
<p>DJ: Do you get any money from the North Korean government? An appearance fee?</p>
<p>DR: No, there’s no money. I do it for free.</p>
<p>Rodman, at Beijing’s international airport before flying to North Korea at on January 6, 2014</p>
<p>DJ: Has Kim Jong-un discussed anything political with you?</p>
<p>DR: I’ve never told this to anyone, but the last time I was there, 
they just came out and started saying stuff about what they want from 
Americans. How they want to rewrite the peace treaty, they want us to 
get the ships out of South Korea. He’s saying the reason why they have 
the nuclear bombs is because they know that Americans think they can 
take over. He says, “I don’t want to bomb anyone. But we keep our 
nuclear weapons because we’re such a small country—that’s the only way 
we can defend ourselves.” They just want people in America and the 
government to know they don’t hate Americans. They want to work with 
Americans. They just want them to abide by the agreement that they wrote
 up years ago.</p>
<p>DJ: So up until that point you had never talked politics?</p>
<p>DR: No, it was more casual, just joking and laughing. But when I 
heard that [political discussion] me and my friend were like, Oh my God,
 now it’s getting serious. That’s the first time I ever heard that. That
 takes it to a whole different level.</p>
<p>DJ: And how did you respond?</p>
<p>DR: He said, “Well, we just want to try to straighten this out and 
try to open the doors with Americans.” I thought that I was going to get
 engaged in trying to negotiate some type of deal with the Americans. 
And after all of that, we came back for a dinner, and the first thing he
 said was, “Don’t worry about it. That’s OK. Don’t do that. We don’t 
want you to get involved.”</p>
