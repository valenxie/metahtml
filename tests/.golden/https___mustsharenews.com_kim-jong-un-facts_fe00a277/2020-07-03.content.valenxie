<h2 class="rm-manual">Best Believe It: Kim Jong-Un Is A Ladies Man</h2>
<p>At first glance, North Korea isn’t a scary place.</p>
<p>It’s actually pretty picturesque – Pyongyang is a charming 
post-Soviet city, complete with sprawling plazas and tree-lined 
boulevards.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Photo by Raphael Olivier (via CNN)</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pyongyang-architecture/index.html?gallery=%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F160809091147-pyongyang5.jpg" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>What makes North Korea so scary is the regime that governs it.</p>
<p>Led by Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, the hermit state is a world straight out of 1984.</p>
<p>There are people who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reEZn3mJ-Fo" rel="noopener">watch your every move</a>, tracking who enters apartment buildings and how long they spend there.</p>
<p>Under Mr Kim’s watch, some of the worst abuses against human rights have also been carried out in North Korea.</p>
<p>From executions and kidnappings to labour camps, there are many 
bone-chilling stories about life in the northern half of the Korean 
peninsula.</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">“I’m coming out!”</h3>
<p>On Tuesday (12 Jun), Mr Kim, 34, shed his reclusive persona when he made the 6-hour journey to Singapore to meet <a href="https://mustsharenews.com/trump-kim-bromance/" rel="noopener">American President Donald Trump</a>.</p>
<p>Hailed by <a href="https://mustsharenews.com/singapore-summit-worth-it/" rel="noopener">some</a> as the biggest diplomatic breakthrough of the 21st century, their meeting was certainly historic.</p>
<p>But after his 48 hours in Singapore, little is known about Mr Kim Jong-un, beyond the fact that he has a trendy haircut.</p>
<p>So here are 10 facts that show he’s more than just a cruel dictator.</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">1. He appreciates K-Pop</h3>
<p>Well, not K-Pop as you know it.</p>
<p>Mr Kim might actually be the Simon Cowell of North Korea, with his own One Direction to show for it.</p>
<p>His protege? Moranbang, an all-female music group.</p>
<p>Its members were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycdDHP7QfWo" rel="noopener">allegedly hand-picked</a> by Mr Kim, who enjoys their blend of pop and rock styles.</p>
<p>You won’t find the group’s tunes on Spotify but they’re readily available on YouTube.</p>
<p>Our favourite?</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">2. He’s a ladies’ man</h3>
<p>Think that Mr Kim’s just another female-loving politician?</p>
<p>Well, he is.</p>
<p>But that love is actually reciprocated — or at least appears to be.</p>
<p>Propaganda shots Photos of Mr Kim being adored by North Korean ladies are regularly released by the administration.</p>

<p>We’re not sure if his appeal crosses borders though.</p>
<p>If the man appeared on your Tinder – how would you swipe?</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">3. He’s a taken man</h3>
<p>In case you wanted to swipe right… don’t!</p>
<p>Mr Kim’s wife, Ms Ri Sol-ju might come after you.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Photo by Inter Korean Press Corp/NurPhoto (via Getty Images)</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/13/know-kim-jong-uns-wife-ri-sol-ju-daughter-kim-ju-ae-7626672/" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>BBC did <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-18986249" rel="noopener">report</a> once that Mr Kim Jong-un’s father hastily arranged his son’s marriage in 2008.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the couple except the fact that they have a daughter together.</p>
<p class="">Metro <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/13/know-kim-jong-uns-wife-ri-sol-ju-daughter-kim-ju-ae-7626672/" rel="noopener">reports</a> that her name is Kim Ju-ae.</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">4. He studied in Switzerland</h3>
<p>Mr Kim might have chosen to speak Korean during the Singapore Summit, but don’t assume the man isn’t fluent in English.</p>
<p>He reportedly spent some time studying in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Bustle <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/where-did-kim-jong-un-go-to-school-in-switzerland-he-reportedly-had-a-lavish-youth-in-europe-9348179" rel="noopener">reports</a> that in 2009, Mr Kim attended the <a href="http://www.isberne.ch/" rel="noopener">International School of Berne</a>, a private English-language boarding school.</p>
<p>One look at the school’s website and it makes sense that a young Mr Kim was sent there — it appears to be filled with Asians.</p>
<p>But Mr Kim apparently kept a low profile during his studies and didn’t tell anybody about his famous heritage.</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">5. He has a thing for sneakers</h3>
<p>According to his classmates from the Swiss school, Mr Kim boasted an “amazing collection of sneakers worth thousands of pounds”.</p>
<p>These days, he dresses more modestly — all black all day, every day.</p>
<p>In case you need a dose of Kim-spiration for work tomorrow:</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/mustsharenews/?ref=br_rs" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">6. He might have gone under the knife</h3>
<p>Think Madam <a href="https://mustsharenews.com/rosmah-mansor/" rel="noopener">Rosmah Mansor</a> is the only one who’s visited a plastic surgeon?</p>
<p>In 2013, reports swirled that Mr Kim had plastic surgery to look more like his grandfather, Mr Kim Il-sung.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see why Mr Kim Jong-un would do that — the elder Mr Kim is still revered as the father of North Korea.</p>
<p>But North Korea has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9822936/North-Korea-hits-out-at-sordid-Kim-Jong-un-plastic-surgery-rumours.html" rel="noopener">strongly denied</a> these reports, calling the idea of their Supreme Leader undergoing plastic surgery “unimaginable”.</p>
<p>You be the judge:</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-Kim-Jong-Un" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">7. He travels with his own toilet</h3>
<p>Your stools tell a lot about you. They can probably reveal what you ate for lunch and any diseases you might have.</p>
<p>That’s probably why Mr Kim travels with his own toilet.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.theweek.co.uk/94221/why-kim-jong-un-brought-his-own-toilet-to-singapore-and-other-weird-summit-facts" rel="noopener">The Week</a>,
 the practice stems from Mr Kim’s fear that foreign agents will use his 
stools to help their states take advantage of North Korea.</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">8. He’s a basketball superfan</h3>
<p>Ever wondered why basketball legend Dennis Rodman is always hanging around Pyongyang?</p>
<p>That’s because Mr Kim is reported to be a huge basketball fan.</p>
<p>In fact, a schoolmate of his from the <a href="http://www.isberne.ch/" rel="noopener">International School of Berne</a> said that Mr Kim used to spend his school days drawing Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>And when Mr Kim met Rodman, he even showed him his “<a href="http://www.realclearlife.com/travel/kim-jong-un-parties-massive-private-island-called-north-koreas-ibiza/" rel="noopener">personal island</a>“.</p>
<p>That’s you thinking dirty, not us.</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">9. Someone analysed his signature</h3>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/06/what-s-in-a-signature-the-traits-revealed-in-kim-jong-un-and-donald-trump-s-signatures.html" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>Mr Kim’s signature at the <a href="https://mustsharenews.com/singapore-summit-worth-it/" rel="noopener">Singapore Summit</a> was <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/06/what-s-in-a-signature-the-traits-revealed-in-kim-jong-un-and-donald-trump-s-signatures.html" rel="noopener">analysed</a> by experts.</p>
<p>They found that it portrayed the leader as a reserved character and deeply intuitive.</p>
<p>He’s also an introvert, evident from the large spaces in between strokes.</p>
<p>But even experts couldn’t figure out if it was signed in Korean or English.</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">10. He’s part of a dysfunctional family</h3>
<p>Thought the Kardashians were messy? Meet the Kims, courtesy of <a href="https://time.com/4681304/north-korea-kim-family-album/" rel="noopener">TIME‘s</a> useful family tree.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://time.com/4681304/north-korea-kim-family-album/" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>Unlike most other family trees, a “deceased” here doesn’t always mean natural death.</p>
<p>Mr Kim’s half-brother Mr Kim Jong-nam was brutally murdered in Kuala Lumpur last year.</p>
<p>And Mr Kim Jong-un’s uncle, Mr Chang Song-thaek was accused of being a counter-revolutionary and was <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2014/01/26/4/0401000000AEN20140126000800315F.html" rel="noopener">executed in 2013</a>.</p>
<p>Chilling stuff.</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">Bonus</h3>
<p>If you can’t get enough of Mr Kim, catch him on the big screen in The Interview.</p>
<p>Well, a hilarious depiction of him at least.</p>
