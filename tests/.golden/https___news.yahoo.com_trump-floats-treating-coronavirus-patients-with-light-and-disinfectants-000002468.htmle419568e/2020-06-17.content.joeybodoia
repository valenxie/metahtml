<p>At an unusually contentious briefing Thursday of the coronavirus task
 force, President Trump floated the idea that people infected with 
COVID-19 might be treated using injections of disinfectant and 
applications of ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>Trump brought up those theories in the context of a presentation by 
William Bryan, a scientist at the Department of Homeland Security, about
 research indicating that the virus can be killed on surfaces and in 
aerosols by <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/sunlight-destroys-coronavirus-very-quickly-new-government-tests-find-but-experts-say-pandemic-could-still-last-through-summer-200745675.html">heat, humidity, sunlight </a>and
 disinfectants, specifically bleach and isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. 
None of the medical experts at the briefing suggested that these were 
plausible treatments for people already infected.</p>
<p>“Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s 
ultraviolet or just very powerful light. And I think you said that 
hasn’t been checked, but we’re going to test it,” Trump said. “And then I
 said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, either through 
the skin or some other way.”</p>
<p>As Bryan looked on uncomfortably, the president went on to speculate 
about the possibility of using disinfectants as a treatment.</p>
<p>“And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute, 
one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by 
injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the 
lungs and does a tremendous number on the lungs,” Trump continued.</p>
<p>“It would be interesting to check that. That you’re gonna have to use
 medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me, so we’ll see.”</p>
<p>Asked directly whether Trump’s suggestion that injecting bleach or 
using light to treat COVID-19 made sense, Bryan said his laboratory was 
not pursuing those ideas.</p>
<p>The temperatures Bryan’s laboratory had been researching in terms of 
their effect on the coronavirus were in the range of 70 degrees to 95 
degrees. Normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees.</p>

<p>Trump, who has long held out hope that the virus would “disappear” 
with rising springtime temperatures, touted Bryan’s findings as proof 
that he had been right all along. At the same time, the president said 
he had not read new studies that seemed to show that the drugs <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/touted-by-trump-hydroxychloroquine-and-remdesivir-fail-as-coronavirus-therapy-in-preliminary-studies-185031030.html">hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir</a>, which he has championed despite a lack of clinical trials, were not effective in treating COVID-19.</p>
<p>Pressed by reporters on whether Bryan’s findings were enough to 
guarantee that it was safe to reopen the country in the coming weeks, 
Trump dialed back expectations.</p>
<p>“I hope people enjoy the sun, and if it has an impact that’s great,” 
Trump said. “I’m just hearing this, not really for the first time, 
there’s been a rumor that, a very nice rumor, that you go outside in the
 sun or you have heat and that does have an affect on other viruses. But
 now we get it from one of the great laboratories in the world, I have 
to say.”</p>
<p>The president then returned to his theory that light and heat might be harnessed to treat patients sickened by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there’s 
any way that you can apply light and heat to cure, you know? If you 
could, and maybe you can, maybe you can’t,” Trump said. “Again, I say, 
maybe you can, maybe you can’t. I’m not a doctor, but I’m like a person 
who has a good — you know what.”</p>
<p>Trump then turned to Dr. Deborah Birx, one of the leading scientific 
experts on the task force, and asked, “Have you ever heard of that?”</p>
<p>“Not as a treatment,” Birx responded. “I mean, certainly fever is a 
good thing. When you have a fever it helps your body respond.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s a great thing to look at,” Trump added.</p>
<p>When Washington Post reporter Phil Rucker then told Trump that people
 tuned into the briefings not to hear rumors, but to learn useful 
information, Trump responded, “I’m the president and you’re fake news.”</p>
<p>Dismayed physicians, however, took to Twitter during the briefing to 
warn patients not to use common cleaning products to counteract the 
coronavirus.</p>
<p>Hi, ER Doc here.</p>
<p>Do NOT inject or consume ANY disinfectants in an attempt to kill COVID19.</p>
