<h3 class="rm-manual">Ronald Reagan -- April 28, 1981</h3>
<p>Two months after Reagan’s inauguration, a deranged gunman fired a 
bullet that lodged three inches from the president's heart. He'd won the
 presidency in a landslide, and his nonchalant heroism after being 
wounded did nothing to detract from that luster: Reagan had walked into 
the emergency room under his power and cracked wise with the doctors who
 saved his life. Four weeks later he went to Capitol Hill for a speech 
that was both a celebration of his survival and a pointed exercise in 
power politics.</p>
<p>Reagan was met with thunderous applause that evening, April 28, 1981,
 and he was clearly touched, beginning his speech by saying simply: "I 
have no words to express my appreciation for that greeting."</p>
<p>But the president had plenty of words in support of his Economic Recovery Program.</p>
<p>"I believe it's essential that the Congress approve this package, 
which I believe will lift the crushing burden of inflation off of our 
citizens and restore the vitality to our economy and our industrial 
machine," Reagan said. "The American people now want us to act and not 
in half measures. They demand and they've earned a full and 
comprehensive effort to clean up our economic mess."</p>
<p>With the help of some 40 Democrats who sided with the Republican in 
the Oval Office over their own House leaders, Congress passed Reagan's 
budget bill in June and his tax-cutting legislation in July.</p>
