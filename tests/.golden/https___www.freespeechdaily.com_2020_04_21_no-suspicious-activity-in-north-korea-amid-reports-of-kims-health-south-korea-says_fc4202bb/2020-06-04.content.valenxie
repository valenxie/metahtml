<h1 class="rm-manual">No suspicious activity in North Korea amid reports of Kim’s health, South Korea says</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span><a href="https://www.freespeechdaily.com/2020/04/">April 21, 2020</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.freespeechdaily.com/category/international/" rel="category tag">International</a></span> </p>
<p><a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/south-korea">South Korean</a> officials reported no unusual activity in North Korea on Tuesday following unconfirmed media reports that leader <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/kim-jong-un">Kim Jong Un</a> was in fragile health after surgery.</p>
<p>But the possibly of high-level instability raised troubling questions
 about the future of a nuclear-armed state that has been steadily 
building an arsenal meant to threaten the U.S. mainland amid stalled 
talks between Kim and U.S. President <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>.</p>
<p>South Korea’s presidential office said Kim appeared to be handling 
state affairs as usual and that it had no information about rumors 
regarding his health. But many will be watching closely for any signs of
 trouble in North Korea, and whether it will address the reports — 
something it has not yet done.</p>

<p>The United States and North Korea appeared to be barreling toward war
 in 2017, with the countries trading insults and threats of destruction.
 The next two years saw a surprising series of summits, including three 
between Kim and Trump, as Kim pursued diplomacy in hopes of ending 
crippling economic sanctions and obtaining security guarantees. But 
through it all he maintained his right to a nuclear arsenal, and most 
diplomacy has stalemated since.</p>
<p>Speculation often surfaces about North Korea’s leadership based on 
attendance at important state events. Kim, who is in his mid-30s, missed
 the celebration of the birthday of his late grandfather and state 
founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, the country’s most important holiday.</p>
<p>But he presided over a meeting on April 11, discussing coronavirus 
prevention and electing his sister as an alternate member of the 
political bureau of the ruling Workers’ Party, according to the North’s 
official Korean Central News Agency. And state media have since reported
 he sent greetings to Syrian President Bashar Assad and Cuban President 
Miguel Diaz-Canel as well as “birthday spreads” to two North Korean 
officials and a new centenarian.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what would happen if Kim is sidelined by health problems or dies.</p>

<p> Coronavirus outbreak: UN says North Korea should allow outside help</p>
<figcaption> Coronavirus outbreak: UN says North Korea should allow outside help </figcaption><p>Cheong
 Seong-Chang, an analyst at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea,
 said political upheaval would be unlikely as Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong,
 is already exercising significant influence within the government, and 
most members of North Korea’s leadership share an interest with the Kim 
family in maintaining the North’s system.</p>
<p>While North Korea has not made clear who would potentially succeed 
Kim, some experts believe Kim Yo Jong would step in as leader, at least 
during a transitional period. Others believe North Korea could be ruled 
by collective leadership of ruling party elites, similar to the 
post-Stalin Soviet Union.</p>
<p>“We have no information to confirm regarding rumors about Chairman 
Kim Jong Un’s health issue that have been reported by some media 
outlets,” South Korean presidential spokesman Kang Min-seok said. “Also,
 no unusual developments have been detected inside North Korea.”</p>
<p>The presidential office later said Kim is believed to be staying at 
an unspecified location outside of Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, 
with some close confidants. It said Kim appeared to be normally engaged 
with state affairs and there wasn’t any unusual movement or emergency 
reaction from North Korea’s ruling party, military or Cabinet.</p>

<p>A U.S. official said the White House was aware before the reports 
appeared late Monday that Kim’s health might be precarious. The official
 said the U.S. had information that Kim may have undergone surgery and 
that complications may have rendered him “incapacitated or worse.” But, 
the official stressed that the U.S. had nothing to confirm the surgery 
had taken place or that any complications had occurred.</p>
<p>The U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter 
publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, would not elaborate on 
where the information came from or when it had been received. The White 
House and State Department had no comment.</p>
<p>Conservative South Korean lawmaker Yoon Sang-hyun, chairman of the 
National Assembly’s foreign affairs and unification committee, said he 
was told by unspecified non-government sources that Kim had surgery for 
cardiovascular problems. But an official from Seoul’s National 
Intelligence Service, who didn’t want to be named, citing office rules, 
said the spy agency couldn’t confirm whether Kim had surgery.</p>
<p>Kim In-chul, spokesman for South Korea’s Foreign Ministry, said Seoul
 and Washington are maintaining close communication but didn’t provide a
 direct answer when asked whether the allies exchanged any meaningful 
intelligence about Kim’s health.</p>

<figcaption> North Korea state TV airs new video of Kim Jong Un riding horse up sacred mountain with aides </figcaption><p>Outside
 governments and media have a mixed record on tracking developments 
among North Korea’s ruling elite, made difficult by the North’s 
stringent control of information about them.</p>
<p>In 2016, South Korean media quoted intelligence officials as saying 
Kim Jong Un had had a former military chief executed for corruption and 
other charges. But months later, North Korea’s state media showed Ri 
Yong Gil alive and serving in new senior posts.</p>
<p>Kim’s absence from state media often triggers speculation. In 2014, 
he vanished from the public eye for nearly six weeks before reappearing 
with a cane. South Korea’s spy agency said days later that he had a cyst
 removed from his ankle.</p>
<p>Kim, believed to be 36, took power upon his father’s death in 
December 2011 and is the third generation of his family to rule the 
country.</p>
