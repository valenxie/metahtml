<p class="rm-manual"> Posted on <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/" rel="bookmark">March 17, 2020</a><span> by <span><a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/author/khawajaenator/" rel="author">Irfan Khawaja</a></span></span><span> under <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/category/covid-19/" rel="category tag">COVID-19</a></span> </p>
<p>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,</p>
<p>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,</p>
<p>To the last syllable of recorded time;</p>
<p>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</p>
<p>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!</p>
<p>Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player,</p>
<p>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,</p>
<p>And then is heard no more. It is a tale</p>
<p>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</p>
<p>Signifying nothing.</p>
<p>–Shakespeare, Macbeth, Act V, Scene 5</p>
<p>I count it as a great blessing that I have so far, at age fifty, 
managed to avoid becoming a father. Amusingly enough, my ex-wife once 
told me, flat out, “Before I met you, I was on the fence about having 
children. I no longer am. You would make a terrible father. So I’ve 
abandoned the idea.” Music to my ears.</p>
<p>And yet, I’ve just had a phone conversation with one of my best 
friends, in which he asked me whether I would temporarily take custody 
of his child in the event that both he and his wife die of COVID-19. 
“Yes,” I say, without hesitation. I actually like his kid, as kids go. 
Granted, the custody he imagines is temporary, until family members 
could come and do a formal adoption. My friend knows me well enough to 
know that coronavirus or no, it makes little sense to turn me into a 
bona fide step-father. One catastrophe is enough.</p>
<p>As he thinks this deeply unpalatable matter through, he’s 
simultaneously forced to work through a set of tedious and mostly 
unanswerable legal questions. Would the State permit a teenaged child to
 live without a guardian in the event of his parents’ decease? Or would 
the child be sucked into the State’s <a href="https://www.nj.gov/dcf/contact/dcpplocal/" rel="noopener">“child protection” bureaucracy</a>?
 Would the State permit a non-blood-relative like me to assume a 
temporary custodial role, or would it overrule the arrangement? Would it
 help to write out an advance directive, and notarize it? How much 
longer are notaries going to be in operation, anyway? Lots of questions 
here, but a hell of a time to have to hire a lawyer.</p>
<p>I tell him that I find it inconceivable that the State would insist 
on such legal niceties under circumstances like these. “That would defy 
common sense,” I say with great confidence. My friend laughs. “Common 
sense. I like that. Suddenly, the State operates on the basis of common 
sense.” I open my mouth to respond, but oddly, no articulate sound 
emerges. The sentence I have in mind begins, “But surely…” and fizzles 
out after that.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Our-Enemy-State-Albert-Nock/dp/1502585634" rel="noopener">Our Friend, the State</a>:
 the minor deity to whose prudence and foresight we owe our welfare. But
 hell, I’m not an anarchist. I’m realist enough to know that we need the
 State. Where would we be without it? If we didn’t have a State, after 
all, who would tie us up in bureaucratic knots when we had heart-rending
 decisions to make about the fate of our loved ones, in the wake of the 
disasters the agencies of the State failed to predict and stop?*</p>
<p>I could quit there with a nice, snarky, libertarianish polemic 
against the State. But the truth is, the call didn’t end there. It ended
 with our favorite topic of conversation, a workplace story. My 
libertarian friends have been serving up heart-warming stories on 
Facebook about the beneficent power of markets in coping with the 
coronavirus. I wish I could share their enthusiasm, but after my 
friend’s story, I don’t. Not that I really did before it.</p>
<p>There was a lot of background noise on the call. “Where the hell are you?” I ask him. “What’s all that noise?”</p>
<p>“I’m in the car,” he says wearily, “coming back from work. It’s noisy.”</p>
<p>“From work?” I ask incredulously. “What the fuck are you doing at 
work? I thought you worked in some hi-tech office. You’re telling me 
they’re not set up for online operations? I work for a fucking 
university, and we transitioned to online operations last week.”</p>
<p>“They are set up for online operations,” he responds. “I mean, we are.”</p>
<p>“Not 100%, you mean?”</p>
<p>“No, 100%, including my job. Everyone. We’re 100% set up for online 
business. They told us flat-out that they had a ‘business continuity 
plan’ that would allow every one of us to work from home anytime they 
decided to put it into effect.”</p>
<p>I can’t help laughing. “What the fuck? So what are they waiting for? A divine mandate?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, sort of,” he says. “They haven’t been ordered by the 
State to close, not yet. So they haven’t. I mean, no liability if they 
don’t, right? They’re going to maintain a ‘physical presence at the 
site’ until they get a legal order to close down.”</p>
<p>Long pause.</p>
<p>“Why?” I ask. The old Nazi line “<a href="https://aaeblog.com/2010/02/17/hier-ist-kein-warum/" rel="noopener">hier ist kein warum</a>“
 goes briefly through my head. Absurd, irrelevant free association, I 
think, and suppress it, only to hear the dim echoes of another 
Germanic-sounding free association drift in. It’s garbled–“fluidity, 
security, reckless something something”–so after the call, I pick the 
relevant book off the shelf and turn to what it actually says:</p>
<p>Thus large scale industry, by its very essence, necessitates 
variations of labour, fluidity of functions, and mobility of the worker 
in all directions. But on the other hand, in its capitalist form it 
reproduces the old division of labor with its ossified particularities. 
We have seen how this absolute contradiction does away with all repose, 
all fixity and all security as far as the worker’s life-situation is 
concerned; how it constantly threatens, by taking away the instruments 
of labor, to snatch from his hands the means of subsistence, and by 
suppressing his specialized function, to make him superfluous. We have 
seen, too, how this contradiction bursts forth without restraint in the 
ceaseless human sacrifices required from the working class, in the 
reckless squandering of labour-powers, and in the devastating effects of
 social anarchy. (Marx, Capital, Vol. 1, Part IV, ch. 15.9)</p>
<p>LOL. Now I’m channeling Marx! The mind does strange things under duress.</p>
<p>“Well, they just said that they wanted business continuity,” he says,
 matter-of-factly. “Used that phrase a lot. ‘Business continuity, 
physical presence,’ shit like that. In other words, they want to convey 
the impression to the outside world that business continues. It looks 
bad if no one is there. Doesn’t matter that they don’t need to be there.
 In the corporate sense, we do need to be there.”</p>
<p>Long pause. “It looks bad.” They can’t be serious. But capitalism is 
serious business. I’ve got one hand holding the phone, so I’ve only got 
the other one free to cover my face. I feel a strong urge to drop the 
phone and cover it with both.</p>
<p>“That’s fucking outrageous,” I say, at last. “But when this shit is 
over, there’ll be a reckoning for these people.” I’m yelling now. 
“There’ll be hell to pay.”</p>
<p>“No, there won’t,” he says.</p>
<p>Long pause.</p>
<p>The call ends soon after that. He’s got to go. It’s late, and he’s got work tomorrow.</p>
<p>*As I wrote this post, I could hear my wife Alison, a 
psychotherapist, talking a colleague through the regulatory hurdles 
required to keep her (the colleague’s) practice going during the 
pandemic. Her conversation with that colleague was analogous to mine 
with my friend:</p>
<p>Alison: You absolutely need to maintain continuity of treatment.</p>
<p> Colleague: But what if that violates State regulations?</p>
<p> Alison: You can’t think about that at a time like this. I can’t 
imagine the State will come down on you for maintaining continuity of 
treatment that happens to violate some regulation during a crisis. Think
 about your patients, not regulations.</p>
<p> Colleague: Right, but I have to think about myself, too.</p>
<p> Alison: Of course you do.</p>

 have yet to read that book. That said, I’m familiar with the 
“market”/”capitalism” distinction, but I don’t think the scenario I 
describe in the second half of the post is distinctive to capitalism or 
could somehow be avoided or ruled out under “markets-not-capitalism.” </p> <p>Imagine
 that we live under anarchism. Now suppose, under anarchism, that we 
have firms with asymmetric bargaining power vis-a-vis workers. Suppose 
that the managers of these firms have a strong emotional investment in 
certain image-conscious business practices. A pandemic comes, and 
despite having a contingency plan in place for going fully online, they 
insist that their workers come in “until things get really bad,” on 
their own understanding of “really bad.” Yes, in the scenario I 
describe, management is waiting around for a directive from the State, 
but that’s a relatively dispensable, superficial, accidental feature of 
the scenario. I think it’s accidental even if you want to make the 
argument that under capitalist regulation, managers tend to defer to 
regulatory authorities (“we’ll close when they order us to close”). 
That’s a highly contingent fact. I think it’s plausible enough to 
imagine callous, unimaginative managers under any system who will invoke
 an employment contract to induce employees to sacrifice their welfare 
to the firm. As long as you have people like that in managerial 
positions, asymmetric bargaining power, and contractual obligations, it 
seems to me that the problem is ineliminable.</p> <p>Not that I’m saying
 that the problem disappears if you abolish either capitalism or 
non-capitalist markets and adopt some form of socialism. Socialism just 
gives you distinctively socialist pathologies rather than capitalist 
ones.</p> <p>I guess I’m very skeptical of the idea that anarchism gets 
us more virtue than state-based capitalism (if that’s what you’re 
suggesting), or that either of the two get us more virtue than 
socialism, or for that matter, that socialism gets us more virtue than 
either. Image-conscious assholes can take control under any system. Once
 they do, the rest of us are in one way or another at their mercy. 
Different systems differ by what form that phenomenon takes, but no 
system eliminates it, or eliminates the need for resistance to it.</p> <p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/?like_comment=5508&amp;_wpnonce=a779145c41" rel="nofollow"><span>Like</span></a><span>Like</span></p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="file:///2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/?replytocom=5508#respond">Reply</a> </p> </article> <ul class=""> <li class=""> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Roderick T.

 I don’t take “capitalism or markets-but-not-capitalism” to refer to 
“the view described in that book you’ve mentioned that I’ve just 
admitted to not having read.” I was taking “capitalism” to refer to free
 markets under a limited state, and “markets-but-not-capitalism” to 
refer generically to any free market view minus the state, not 
necessarily yours. Surely there are (plenty of) non-capitalist free 
market views that accept asymmetric bargaining power in economic 
relations, and my point is, what I say applies to them as much as it 
applies to labor-management relations under capitalism. </p> <p class="rm-manual">If
 it doesn’t apply to your view, your view is unique. I haven’t denied it
 could be unique (or defensible), but “no asymmetric bargaining power 
under anarchist free markets” strikes me as a tough burden to meet–a bit
 like “no net diminution of liberty under democratic state socialism.” I
 can’t say I’ve read every defense of democratic socialism ever written 
(or even keep up with that literature), but it wouldn’t be outlandish to
 be skeptical that socialism preserves liberty, even if some author 
insisted that the claim had been demonstrated in a book one hadn’t (yet)
 read.</p> <p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/?like_comment=5511&amp;_wpnonce=1b55aa210f" rel="nofollow"><span>Like</span></a><span>Like</span></p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="file:///2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/?replytocom=5511#respond">Reply</a> </p> </article> <ul class=""> <li class=""> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Roderick T.

 never heard of “markets-but-not-capitalism” being used to mean *merely*
 markets without the state. Certainly that’s not what we mean by it. By 
that definition, anarcho-capitalists would count as proponents of 
markets-but-not-capitalism.</p> <p class="rm-manual">It’s true that we 
think markets-but-not-capitalism would be the likely *result* of markets
 without the state, but that’s not a matter of definition.</p> <p class="rm-manual">What
 we call capitalism, and what we take to be enabled by state 
intervention in markets, is the concentration of ownership of the means 
of production in the hands of an employing class. In the absence of 
state-enforced capitalism, our claim is that capital ownership would be 
dispersed more widely and equally, alternatives to wage labour such as 
workers’ cooperatives and individual proprietorships would become far 
more viable, and where wage labour did exist, the ready existence of 
alternatives would shift bargaining power in the workers’ favour.</p> <p>Maybe
 our view is “unique,” but it’s been standard among individualist 
anarchists for the past 150 years or so. I’m surprised this is news to 
you! What have you been taking my position, and the C4SS position, to 
be?</p> <p><a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/?like_comment=5512&amp;_wpnonce=64ce2afef4" rel="nofollow"><span>Like</span></a><span>Like</span></p> <p> <a href="file:///2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/?replytocom=5512#respond">Reply</a> </p> </article> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article> <p> <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow ugc">Irfan Khawaja</a> </p> <p> <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/#comment-5513"> March 17, 2020 at 7:40 pm </a> </p> <p>It
 is news to me. But the truth is that I started checking out of the 
libertarian/Objectivist literature maybe six or seven years ago, started
 reading other things, and sort of lost touch with it. I took your view 
to be a much weaker position than (I guess) it turns out to be. I took 
it to be politically identical to anarcho-capitalism, but hitched to a 
thick (rather than thin) and Aristotelian (rather than 
anti-Aristotelian) ethical stance with a left- (rather than right-wing) 
orientation. </p> <p>But with that said, the view you’ve just described doesn’t literally rule out asymmetric bargaining power. </p> <blockquote><p>
 In the absence of state-enforced capitalism, our claim is that capital 
ownership would be dispersed more widely and equally, alternatives to 
wage labour such as workers’ cooperatives and individual proprietorships
 would become far more viable, and where wage labour did exist, the 
ready existence of alternatives would shift bargaining power in the 
workers’ favour.</p></blockquote> <p>Well, even on the most charitable 
interpretation possible, capital ownership dispersed more widely and 
equally, and cooperatives that are more viable may shift bargaining 
power in workers’ favor, but can’t rule out the scenario I described in 
my post. </p> <p>The main point of my describing the scenario was not to
 make a point about views like yours, but to criticize the moral 
character of my friend’s bosses. Granted, I made the point about not 
being overly impressed about libertarians sharing stories about the 
power of markets to deal with the coronavirus. But that’s because most 
libertarians have little to say about the sort of scenario described in 
my post. It’s also because I haven’t seen a libertarian-positive story 
that gets at the heart of the matter: if the virus is a real threat, and
 social distancing is the best means of diluting the threat–of 
“flattening the curve”–how do libertarians propose to do that? Or 
rather, how do libertarians propose to deal with people who refuse to 
engage in social distancing while they (libertarians) uphold a 
categorical ban on the restriction of movement, or restrictions on trade
 or social interaction? And that on top of rejecting the legitimacy of 
state action tout court? </p> <p>I’ve seen libertarians praising the 
gadgets we have in our house that save us from boredom when we’re 
quarantined, or sing the praises of the price system as a means of 
equilibrating supply and demand and saving “us” from shortages. But this
 all strikes me as beside the point. If complicity in state action makes
 for dirty hands, and state power can’t be used to enforce social 
distancing, libertarians are in the position of saying that we’re 
obliged to give up on the best defense we have against this virus. In 
that case–close to the worst-case–we’re talking about 200 million people
 infected, and a million dead in this country alone. </p> <p>The point 
of the second part of the post is to point out that no libertarian qua 
libertarian could rule out the situation my friend found himself in. 
Maybe a view like yours diminishes the likelihood of its happening, but 
that’s not the same thing. Whereas a view that allows for the legitimacy
 of executive orders demanding that business stop, could rule it out. 
Such view might have other downsides, but it wouldn’t have that one. On a
 view like that, my friend wouldn’t be at work.</p> <p>But at a more 
basic level, my point is: only assholes would make someone work under 
these conditions. Whatever the systemic explanation for their 
prevalence, my bedrock claim is that far too many bosses are assholes, 
addicted to stupid PR nostrums, and willing to sacrifice their employees
 to it. They’re everywhere, they control too much, and they don’t 
deserve the salaries they make. I’m partial to any political system that
 allows me to tell them all to go and fuck themselves.</p> <p><a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/?like_comment=5513&amp;_wpnonce=aabffc312f" rel="nofollow"><span>Like</span></a><span>Like</span></p> <p> <a href="file:///2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/?replytocom=5513#respond">Reply</a> </p> </article> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article> <p> Roderick T.

 what is *likely* under stateless markets-without-capitalism with what 
can somehow be *guaranteed* under the state seems like an odd contrast, 
given that your complaint is that the state *isn’t* guaranteeing it. 
After all, stateless markets-without-capitalism has just as much 
capacity to “guarantee” what you’re asking for as the state does. Under 
both systems, the result you want will occur if various people choose to
 act in the relevant ways. What we need to do is compare likelihoods 
with likelihoods. Under which system will workers most likely be 
protected from the situation you’re worried about — one in which 
employers are artificially empowered or one in which they’re not?</p> <p><a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/?like_comment=5514&amp;_wpnonce=c25be0dd96" rel="nofollow"><span>Like</span></a><span>Like</span></p> <p> <a href="file:///2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/?replytocom=5514#respond">Reply</a> </p> </article> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li> <article> <p> Roderick T.

 course I remember your 2018 APS talk, but I guess I misunderstood it. I
 clearly took it to be arguing for a weaker thesis than you intended. I 
basically took it to be arguing for anarcho-capitalism plus a sort of 
thick Aristotelian virtue ethics entailing that exploitation was unjust 
even in cases where it was consensual. I didn’t take that to be 
politically different from anarcho-capitalism; I took it to be ethically
 different, with the rejection of the term “capitalism” denoting that 
latter difference (and/or rejection of the State).* Most right-wing 
anarcho-capitalists wouldn’t come up with an account of consensual 
transactions that were unjust because exploitative. But I accept that 
there are, and you do, so I guess I was focusing on agreements on not 
paying attention to the larger political picture. </p> <p>Surely you 
remember my 1997 ICS paper on exploitation? You described it as 
“ingenious” synthesis of Kantian and Aristotelian insights. I have a 
photographic memory. Selective, maybe, but photographic.</p> <p>*In 
other words, I took you to be using “capitalism” primarily for 
markets-under-the_State, but also by extension to thin versions of 
anarcho-capitalism that treat capitalist-like exploitation as perfectly 
compatible with justice.</p> <p><a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/17/coronavirus-journal-3-creeping-death/?like_comment=5519&amp;_wpnonce=6555e7794d" rel="nofollow"><span>Like</span></a><span>Like</span></p> </article> </li> <li> <article> <p> Roderick T.
