<p class="rm-manual"> Filed under: <a href="http://patterico.com/category/general/" rel="category tag">General</a> — Dana @ 2:08 pm </p>
<p class="rm-manual">[guest post by Dana]</p>
<p>While still in Vietnam, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-claim-that-kim-jong-un-didnt-know-about-otto-warmbier-at-odds-with-court-testimony">President Trump was asked </a>if
 he had discussed college student Otto Warmbier with Kim Jong Un. The 
22-year old had been detained in North Korea after being convicted for 
stealing a propaganda poster. He was released after a year, only to 
return home in a comatose state and dying shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>Talking in Vietnam on Thursday about Kim’s role in the fate of 
Warmbier, who died in June 2017, Trump said: “He felt badly about it. He
 felt very badly.” He added that the two leaders had discussed 
Warmbier’s death privately. He added: “He tells me that he didn’t know 
about it and I will take him at his word.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/01/politics/otto-warmbier-family-trump-north-korea/index.html">Moreover</a>,
 claiming that he didn’t believe leadership knew about it, he claimed 
that it would not have been in Kim’s interest to so severely wound an 
American: </p>
<p>…Trump told reporters he believed Kim’s denial in part because it 
would not be in Kim’s interest for Warmbier to wind up in a coma.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that the top leadership knew about it,” Trump said. “I
 don’t believe that he (Kim) would have allowed that to happen.”</p>
<p>Earlier in 2017, President Trump expressed his belief that Warmbier was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warmbiers-parents-push-back-on-trump-comments-blame-kims-evil-regime-for-sons-death">“tortured beyond belief by North Korea.”</a></p>
<p>As a reminder, during the summit in Hanoi, the president had referred to the murderous leader as a “friend”. </p>
<p>Responding to the president’s belief that Kim Jong Un was unaware of Warmbier, his parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warmbiers-parents-push-back-on-trump-comments-blame-kims-evil-regime-for-sons-death">rebuked Trump</a>, saying: </p>
<p>We have been respectful during this summit process. Now we must speak
 out. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son 
Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty 
and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that. </p>
<p>As a result of the backlash for Trump’s comments, Kellyanne Conway did cleanup duty on Fox News earlier today: </p>
<p>White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway clarified in an interview 
Friday on Fox News, however, that the president agrees with the family 
and holds North Korea “responsible.” She said Trump was only saying 
there’s no indication Kim knew what happened at the time.</p>
<p>“Of course he holds North Korea responsible. He has deep affection 
and shares the grief of the Warmbier family. That will never end,” she 
said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-claim-that-kim-jong-un-didnt-know-about-otto-warmbier-at-odds-with-court-testimony">Jerry Dunleavy points out </a>that when compared with the testimony given by expert witnesses at the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/400779552/20181219-BAH-EH-Warmbier-v-Korea">evidentiary hearing</a>, Trump’s belief that Kim Jong Un was not aware of Otto Warmbier doesn’t hold up: </p>
<p>Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korea specialist at the Fletcher School of Law and 
Diplomacy at Tufts University, and David Hawk, a consultant for the 
Committee on North Korean Human Rights who teaches at the University of 
South Florida, both testified that the North Korean government was 
responsible for the torture and death of Otto.</p>
<p>Sung-Yoon Lee said: “North Korea had been planning to conduct various
 provocative weapons tests all along, and to have a young American 
detainee would have provided North Korea not only with an added layer of
 security, a security blanket, but have a useful pawn with which North 
Korea could compel the U.S.” He added that “hostage-taking is a very 
well-honed craft and tool of North Korea’s diplomacy.”</p>
<p>Lee said Otto’s detention was a strategic decision by the North 
Korean government: “I see calculated provocation, hostage taking as 
North Korea is preparing for a major provocation like its first nuclear 
test in three years, its first long-range missile test in three years.”</p>
<p>Lee also agreed with the judge’s statement that “North Korea seized 
and maintained custody of Otto in order to further its policy goals.” He
 said that Otto was seized during a presidential election year in the 
United States and at a time when North Korea hadn’t tested a nuclear 
weapon in three years.</p>
<p>Yet “just four days after detaining Otto Warmbier, North Korea 
conducted a nuclear test on Jan. 6, which is two days shy of Kim Jong 
Un’s birthday.” And the “show trial and confession” of Otto was “very 
much a staple mode of operation in the North Korean system.”</p>
<p>Lee said: “Kim Jong Un is the Supreme Leader… In Korean culture, 
Korean history, the man on top has always held supreme power, the Korean
 kings of the past.” North Korea was “the most advanced, most perfected 
totalitarian state in world history” and had a unique ability “to 
coerce, to control, to terrorize people, and to invade their private 
realm.”</p>
<p>David Hawk spoke about the “systemic and regularized torture in the 
initial places of detention and interrogation” in North Korea. He was 
clearly being interrogated, and they wanted a confession from him. And 
he was obviously in his testimony scared for his life if he didn’t 
confess to hostile acts taken on behalf of the U.S. government.” </p>
<p>Further: </p>
<p>Lee told the Washington Examiner: “The notion that Kim Jong Un, the 
supreme leader of the nation with the most rigidly vertical power 
hierarchy in history, was uninformed of the hostage-taking, torture, and
 extrajudicial killing of Otto Warmbier … is ludicrous.”</p>
<p>He added that Trump’s comments “challenge the letter and spirit of 
the landmark ruling by a federal judge in the case of Warmbiers vs DPRK”
 and “unwittingly empower the criminal regime of Kim Jong Un.”</p>
<p>This would be consistent, given President Trump’s admiration for 
strongmen. (See: Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin, Saudi Crown Prince 
Mohammad bin Salman, Xi Jinping, among others.)</p>
<p>As I was finishing this post, I checked once more to see if the 
President had tweeted about the matter, given the backlash he has faced.
 Sure enough:</p>
<p class="">Interestingly, he doesn’t specifically call out Kim Jong Un 
as being responsible for the death of Warmbier. Instead, he sticks with 
“North Korea,” essentially still giving Kim Jong Un a pass. </p>

 is a murderous dictator who deserves to be shoved into a wood-chipper. 
But that doen’t move negotiations forward. Nixon negotiated with Mao and
 Chou. We supported Somoza and Pinochet. OUR hands have never been 
clean, and insisting they are is right up there with “Gentlemen don’t 
read other gentlemen’s mail.”</p> <p>Trump has gone the extra mile. NO 
ONE can say that he did not try and try past the point of 
reasonableness. Now, he’s done. At least I pray he is done. </p> <p>Back to Plan A, as Trump himself explained long ago on Meet the Press:</p> <blockquote>
<p>TIM RUSSERT, MEET THE PRESS: Let me talk about some of the issues. 
One is North Korea. And you say that you, as president, would be willing
 to launch a pre-emptive strike against North Korea’s nuclear 
capability.</p> <p>MR. TRUMP: First, I’d negotiate. I would negotiate 
like crazy. And I’d make sure that we tried to get the best deal 
possible. Look, Tim, if a man walks up to you on a street in Washington—
 because this doesn’t happen, of course, in New York. But if a man walks
 up and puts a gun to your head and says, “Give me your money,” wouldn’t
 you rather know where he’s coming from before he had the gun in his 
hand? And these people in three or four years are going to be having 
nuclear weapons. They’re going to have those weapons pointed all over 
the world and specifically at the United States.</p> <p>And wouldn’t you
 be better off solving this really potentially, unbelievable—and the 
biggest problem? I mean, we can talk about the economy, we can talk 
about Social Security. The biggest problem this world has is nuclear 
proliferation. And we have a country out there, North Korea, which is 
sort of wacko, which is not a bunch of dummies. And they are going out 
and they are developing nuclear weapons. And they’re not doing it 
because they’re having fun doing it. They’re doing it for a reason. And 
wouldn’t it be good to sit down and really negotiate something and 
ideally negotiate? Now, if that negotiation doesn’t work, you’d better 
solve the problem now than solve it later, Tim. And you know it and 
every politician knows it, and nobody wants to talk about it. </p>

 If you know how to hear to Trump, as NYers have learned from decades of
 ear-weary pressers, what the world saw was a tired old bullsh-tter

 Gaddafi pitched his tent on an estate belonging to Donald Trump in 
suburban New York yesterday, according to reports. The Libyan leader is 
scheduled to attend the UN general assembly this week. He had been 
struggling to find a plot to accommodate the large Bedouin tent he takes
 with him when travelling abroad.</p> <p>Workers were seen yesterday 
erecting a tent and satellites in the glamorous neighbourhood of Bedford
 on an estate owned by Trump. Local officials tried to stop them, saying
 it was illegal to build a temporary residence without a permit. An ABC 
News helicopter filmed a large tent on the 113-acre Seven Springs 
estate, with rugs and patterned wall hangings. Green and yellow fabric 
lined the walls in a pattern dotted with images of small brown camels, 
according to a local newspaper website image. Last night a state 
department official told AP the tent might be used for entertaining by 
Gadaffi, but he would not be sleeping there.</p> <p>Doors all over New 
York have been slammed in the colonel’s face, but Trump says he has 
rented part of a large property in Westchester county to Middle Eastern 
tenants who may be associated with Gadaffi.</p> <p>Gadaffi last month 
wanted to erect a tent in New Jersey, where the Libyan embassy owns 
property, but the US government said he could not. A request to set up 
tent in Central Park was also turned down.</p> <p>Gadaffi arrived in New

 If your point is that we are stuck wuth Trump, I agree but caring about
 how Trump conducts foreign policy with Kim is not a detail. Kim has 
nukes and says he will use them. You may be willing to trust Trump as he

flattery is singularly different from what Kim gets at home; Trump’s

can offer him no more than loyalty grounded in fear. Trump however, can

 the inevitable shifting of low-earth-orbit ops to private firms for 
commercial development freeing up NASA and other nations developing

 Jong Un feklt he had to release Otto Warmbier because he needed it as a
 conditioon of meeting Donald Trump, and he was afraid of Donald Trump 
after Trump had tweeted: </p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/948355557022420992?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/948355557022420992?lang=en</a></p><blockquote> Donald J. Trump‏Verified account @realDonaldTrump <p>
 North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is
 on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food 
starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but 
it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button 
works! </p> <p>4:49 PM – 2 Jan 2018 </p>
</blockquote> <p> My button works! </p> <p>Meaning maybe his “button” 
doesn’t work; i.e. the U.S. has sabotaged something, or could destroy 
missile in flight, and Donald Trump has a loose lip. Trump had been 
trying to alert Kim that if he tried to use nuclear weapons, he would 
suffer destruction – he would lose. And herer he was telling him that 
the United States was not afraid of what he might try. Kim Jong Un 
almost instantly reversed course, and stopped all his threats. He had to
 negotiate – he had to stall Donald Trump. </p> <p>And to do this he has to release Otto Warmbier.</p> <p>Problem:
 Otto Warmbier had undergone too much torture; seen too many other 
people suffer; or had contact with some long term secret political 
prisoners, whose names he could reveal, maybe Japanse it doesn’t want to
 admit it is still holding or North Koreans who could have told him 
tales – maybe even about the nuclear program, or whatever they felt they
 needed to keep highly secret – for the North Korean state to feel that 
they could release him. (I mean the way they felt they felkt they 
couldn’t, or were afraid to. It is not like this is actually necessary 
or would make a difference, except for fools, and there are very few 
real fools who deal with North Korea.)</p> <p>Kim’s solution: Release him, alive, but in such a way that he will never regain consciousness. </p> <p>(North
 Korea probably didn’t expect the Warmbier family to turn off life 
support, so they thought they were safe from an accusation of having 
killed him.)</p> <p> That’s what probably happened.</p> <p>He was 
originally tortured because Kim just had to have a show trial where he 
confessed – it was not enough to give him along sentence over his 
protestations of innocence or in total secrecy. At that time it was 
expected he’d be kept locked up for a very very long time. So they 
didn’t worry about who or waht he would be exposed to, or what would 
happen if he was released.</p> <span> Sammy Finkelman (102c75) — </span> <span><a href="http://patterico.com/2019/03/01/clean-hands-president-trump-gives-kim-jong-un-a-pass-in-the-death-of-otto-warmbier/#comment-2195628"> 3/4/2019 @ 1:14 pm</a> </span> <p></p> </li> <li> <p> </p><blockquote><p>Here is Trump saying he respects Putin. </p></blockquote> <p>Just
 words. When dealing with a foe, it never makes sense to belittle them
