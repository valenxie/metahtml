<p>Over 15,100 people have been infected with the novel coronavirus 
(COVID-19) globally over the past day, bringing the total number of 
confirmed cases above 191,100, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said 
in its latest report.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organisation, which declared the 
COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on 11 March, 191,127 cases have been 
confirmed worldwide, with 15,123 new ones over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The virus has already put entire cities on lockdown, led to travel 
restrictions, and forced the cancellation of big events such as the 
Eurovision Song Contest, and the Coachella as well as Glastonbury music 
festivals.</p>
<p>The novel coronavirus, now officially named COVID-19, was first 
registered in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The virus 
quickly spread to other countries around the globe, with Italy becoming 
the worst affected nation in Europe.</p>

doctor from the Italian Red Cross' biocontainment unit, said.</p> <p class="rm-manual">A
 team of 10 Chinese medical specialists has come to Italy with the 
assistance of the Chinese Red Cross. With nearly 33,200 confirmed cases,
 Italy is suffering from the biggest coronavirus outbreak outside of 
China. On Thursday, its death toll overtook the Chinese one, jumping to 
3,405.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"They are suggesting that we be stricter
 on social distancing. In China social distancing measures were tougher 
than in Italy, and they really believe that this is the measure that can
 stop the spread," Mogini said.</p> <p class="rm-manual">He noted that the Chinese doctors in Italy met with their counterparts and local authorities to share their experience.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"It
 is great for us to see how they are donating their expertise, their

 more important, Mogini went on, Chinese doctors who have gone through

 has been under quarantine since March 9. People have been asked to stay
 home and only go out for essential activities. All entertainment sites

 (Sputnik), Anastasia Levchenko - Italy’s northern regions, the worst 
affected by the coronavirus outbreak, are likely to see a peak of cases 
soon, while prospects for the south remain unclear, Valerio Mogini, a 
doctor from the Italian Red Cross’ biocontainment unit involved in the 
response since the onset of the outbreak, said.</p> <p class="rm-manual">On
 Wednesday, COVID-19 took 475 lives in Italy, which has been the highest
 one-day death toll for any country since the beginning of the epidemic.
 On Thursday, the number of fatalities rose by 427 to 3,405, surpassing 
the Chinese death toll, which stands at 3,245. In total, Italy has 
registered nearly 33,200 coronavirus cases.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"In
 my opinion, what we are going to face is a peak in northern Italy 
pretty soon, but it might be different in the rest of the country. The 
spread [of the disease] is going on, but now at least it will probably 
be slowed down by the containment and social distancing measures of the 
government," Mogini said.</p> <p class="rm-manual">According to the 
doctor, the current high mortality rate may be actually "consequences of
 what happened before the social distancing" was introduced.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"Those
 people who are now in the intensive care units, they were probably 
infected quite some time ago, so it means that probably they got 
infected before the measures and we still need time to see how the 
measures are working. You know, the virus takes about 5-15 days from the
 first contact to actually develop the symptoms, and when someone 
develops the symptoms, it takes probably one week before he or she needs
 intensive care unit," he explained.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Asked 
whether he believes that the south could avoid a situation similar to 
the one unfolding in the northern regions, he expressed hope for that 
but refrained from making projections.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"I think
 that we will have cases, but I hope that we are not going to face the 
same situation that we are facing in the north of Italy. This is our

problems that hospitals are confronting now, he highlighted the lack of 
personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"The
 real problem is that so far it is pretty hard to buy and obtain

from the Italian market, and they have started a program to make the 
industry produce more of PPEs," the medic said.</p> <p class="rm-manual">He

 (Sputnik) - The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is likely to 
struggle with managing the surge in patients who will test positive for 
the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), given that the institution has 
suffered during a decade of austerity characterized by overcapacity, 
staff shortages, and government inaction, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS 
Public (KONP) non-profit organization Dr John Puntis said on Friday.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"The
 NHS is not in such a good position as it could have been, so one would 
say over the last ten years it's been hit by austerity and there are 
some very clear indications of that in terms of there being 17,000 fewer
 hospital beds, 100,000 staff vacancies and 40,000 fewer nurses. There 
hasn't been the investment there should have been," Puntis said.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 KONP co-chair went on to argue that staff within the health service had
 become increasingly anxious about their own vulnerability to COVID-19, 
claiming there was an immediate need to ensure that health sector 
workers receive protective clothing. If that was not done, he said, the 
already evident strain on the NHS would only get worse, ultimately 
compounding the issue as the UK struggles to deal with the outbreak.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"The
 NHS, before the virus even, all the performance figures show 
deterioration in terms of A&amp;E [Accident and Emergency] targets, 
waiting lists, trolley waits in A&amp;E … they all get worse, and that 
reflects the relatively poor state of affairs. Staff are panicking about
 risk because of inadequate provision of protective clothing. If we 
don't protect front line health workers, including ambulance staff and 
paramedics, if they get sick that compounds the strain on the service 
very considerably," Puntis stated.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Previous 
government proposals to pay private manufacturers to construct 
additional ventilators for intensive care units were also questioned, 
given it would necessarily involve companies employing staff and 
resources that had previously not been used to produce medical 
equipment.</p> <p class="rm-manual">A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris
 Johnson had claimed earlier this week that the prime minister would be 
speaking to British manufacturers about the possibility of creating 
additional ventilators for the NHS, with Honda and Vauxhall having 
allegedly been asked to help.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Such policies 
would not necessarily be as simple as they appear, Puntis claimed, 
especially as the NHS was already undermanned in terms of properly 
trained staff with experience in operating the kind of equipment now 
needed.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"Getting more ventilators is only part 
of the solution. The flippant remark is that we get more ventilators and
 train doctors on how to use them ... this is the point where you need 
properly trained nursing staff. Although they have put the invitation 
out to manufacturing to switch to producing ventilators, it's been 
pointed out that medical equipment has to be made to very high standards
 so it's not necessarily that simple," he argued.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 NHS also faces severe overcapacity issues, evident after a letter from 
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens was made public on Tuesday. 
Stevens called on hospitals to cancel all non-urgent surgeries for three
 months from April 15, in order to free up approximately 30,000 beds for
 potential COVID-19 patients.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"The other thing 
is that bed occupancy in the NHS has been running at over 95 percent and
 normally intensive care is pretty full too, so it's not like there's a 
lot of empty space just waiting for patients to come in," Puntis stated.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 NHS, itself always a hot topic at election time, has come under 
ever-increasing scrutiny following the emergence of the coronavirus 
disease in the UK. Campaigners and opposition politicians have 
persistently criticized the government over what they see as a 
persistent inability to handle the UK's health needs, a point 
demonstrated by a glaring bed shortage that has already seen the loss of
 some 17,000 hospital beds ever since the Conservative Party regained 
office in 2010.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Such capacity issues alongside a
 reduction in staffing levels would appear to indicate that the UK 
remains ill-equipped to deal with COVID-19 in the event it continues to 
spread, a sentiment shared by Puntis who stated that the current 
situation in the UK was already a crisis.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"Everyone
 accepts we're now in a crisis because of this new disease that's quite a
 lot more virulent than seasonal influenza. It's much bigger than that. 
It's already having an extraordinary, devastating effect on public 
life," the non-profit co-chair stated.</p> <p class="rm-manual">As of 
Thursday, a total of 137 people are believed to have died after 
contracting COVID-19 in the UK, with the government rushing to fast 
track emergency legislation to contain any further spread, including 
measures to close schools, grant police additional powers to detain 
those suspected of carrying the disease and restrict or outright ban 
public gatherings.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p>

UK manufacturers union said in a statement on Thursday.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"There
 are alarm bells going off right across the manufacturing sector with 
the prospect of substantial lay-offs looming. Order books are collapsing
 and this is creating immediate cashflow issues for companies which need
 addressing within days not weeks," the union’s chief executive Stephen

 union added that even before the COVID-19 outbreak, economic results 
for the first quarter of 2020 showed that both domestic and foreign 
orders had significantly slumped, placing manufacturers in an

 high mortality rate from the COVID-19 in Italy could be due to a large 
percentage of senior citizens in the population, Vice Minister of Health
 Pierpaolo Sileri told Sputnik.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Italy suffers 
from an abnormally high COVID-19 mortality rate of about 7 percent, with
 most of the people succumbing to the disease being over 80-years-old. 
For comparison, Spain currently has a COVID-19 mortality rate of 
approximately 4.5 percent, while France and Germany have mortality rates
 of about 2.2 percent and 0.26 percent, respectively.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"Yes,
 this might be linked to the average age of the Italian population ... 
The elderly over 80-years-old are 7 percent of the population," Sileri, 
himself infected with COVID-19, told Sputnik via email.</p> <p class="rm-manual">He stressed that the Italian healthcare system prioritizes elderly care, leading to a longer lifespan among citizens.</p> <p class="rm-manual">"But,
 obviously, with age comes the fragility of health, and the coronavirus 
complications become fatal," the vice minister said.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Italy
 is the leading European country when it comes to the spread of 
COVID-19, with more than 35,000 cases and a death toll nearing 3,000.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p>
