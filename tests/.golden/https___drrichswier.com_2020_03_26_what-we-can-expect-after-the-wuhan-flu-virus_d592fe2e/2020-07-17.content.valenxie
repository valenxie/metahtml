<p>By the time the Wuhan flu, coronavirus (COVID-19) has run its course,
 what can we expect from the fall-out? Hopefully, we will learn from 
this episode and make changes to address future epidemics, and believe 
me, this will not be the end of it as the media has discovered such 
disasters are bigger business than mere politics. What can we expect 
though from this episode and what awaits us in the months ahead?</p>
<p>First, this will be on everyone’s mind as we head to the voting 
booths in November. As of now, President Trump has been getting 
favorable poll ratings for his handling of the problem, so this 
shouldn’t effect him in a negative way. However, the key will be to see 
how the economy bounces back. It will undoubtedly take a dip in the 
Spring, but when the panic is over and life begins to return to normal, 
will another bull market emerge? If not, this could present a serious 
problem for the Republicans. As of now, the American public doesn’t 
blame President Trump for the declining stock markets, but when this is 
over, they will want to see it come roaring back.</p>
<p>Now that stocks are down, shrewd investors will be picking up some 
bargain stocks and making a killing. Transportations may be slow to 
rebound, but others should come back faster, such as electronics and 
food related companies. One of the biggest surprises during the panic 
was our attachment to paper products. Who would have thought toilet 
paper, paper towels, and tissues would be so much in demand? Companies 
such as Scott Paper, Kimberly-Clark, and Procter &amp; Gamble should be 
sitting pretty following the panic.</p>
<p>Likewise, pharmacies have taken a noticeable upturn and will continue to grow.</p>
<p>Supply chains will need to be re-evaluated and improved in order to 
prevent another product shortage in the future. Freight truck sales are 
booming and will continue to do so to help in this regard. Freight 
trains should also do well.</p>
<p>People have learned the need for maintaining emergency supplies on 
hand. Look for increased sales in refrigerators and freezers to 
accommodate this. Shelving, storage and security items should also do 
well.</p>
<p>The service industry should prosper substantially; “Sit down” 
restaurants will eventually recover but there will be an explosion in 
“To Go” ordering, something people have become used to during the panic 
and has altered our eating habits. Look for a revolution in home 
delivery. Walmart, Amazon, and the major Supermarkets have been moving 
in this direction for a long time, but the panic clearly demonstrated 
its viability.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry will take a hit as we were once again reminded 
of the ill-effects of tobacco. Not surprising, liquor sales held strong 
as people got together in impromptu groups and enjoyed libations to pass
 the time of day.</p>
<p>As much as we hate the politically correct expression, “Social 
Distancing,” it will become a part of life from now on as it has become a
 habit. There will be fewer handshakes and hugs, people will keep their 
distance, and there will still be fewer group activities, including 
nonprofits and church meetings. Also watch for surgical masks to become 
more commonplace, as well as the re-introduction of gloves at group 
events.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most noticeable coming attraction will be a baby boom in 
December. As people went into hibernation during the panic, as requested
 by government, they had to find ways to entertain themselves. Hence, we
 are on the verge of a major baby boom, the likes of which will make the
 old New York blackouts seem pale by comparison. Inevitably, even more 
paper products will be needed to accommodate the influx of infants.</p>
<p>Should there be another virus like this, it is hoped we will be 
better prepared. Personally, I would like to see someone take the news 
media to task, but this will likely never happen. And I certainly hope a
 panic such as this never happens again during an election year. This 
was too much of a coincidence for my liking.</p>
<p>By the way, Rod Serling couldn’t have written a better script than what the coronavirus politicians and media did.</p>
<p>Keep the Faith!</p>
<p>P.S. – Also, I have a NEW book, <a href="http://www.phmainstreet.com/mba/government.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Before You Vote: Know How Your Government Works”</a>,
 What American youth should know about government, available in Printed,
 PDF and eBook form. DON’T FORGET GRADUATION DAY. This is the perfect 
gift!</p>
