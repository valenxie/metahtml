<p>Did Beijing botch a coup attempt in Pyongyang due to a high-ranking North Korean mole? <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/north-korea-leader-kim-jong-un-killed-relatives-over-china-coup-plot-11002869">This report from Sky News</a> may explain why pressure from China hasn’t done much to rein in Kim Jong-un, and also <a href="file:///archives/2017/02/14/whodunit-brother-of-north-korea-dictator-murdered-in-malaysian-airport/">why Kim resorted to a high-stakes assassination</a>
 earlier this year in Kuala Lumpur. Not long after taking power, Kim’s 
uncle Jang Song Thaek tried to get him knocked off in favor of Kim 
Jong-nam, a plot that ended badly for both:</p>
<p>According to Japan’s Nikkei Asian Review magazine, Jang met with 
China’s then-president Hu Jintao in Beijing less than a year after Kim 
replaced his late father as North Korea’s leader.</p>
<p>The publication claims Jang proposed toppling the young ruler, with Beijing’s help, in favour of Kim’s elder half-brother.</p>
<p>But he did not get a clear answer from the Chinese leader who was dealing with his own problems at home, the report states.</p>
<p>An ally of Kim within the Chinese government, Zhou Yongkang, later 
secretly informed him of the coup plot, on which the dictator is said to
 have flown into a rage.</p>
<p>This is certainly a better explanation for Jang’s abrupt fall from grace than merely <a href="file:///archives/2013/12/24/was-kim-jong-un-just-wasted-when-he-started-that-bloody-purge-of-executions/">the outcome of a drunken rage by Dear Leader</a>. Only a few months earlier, Jang seemed ascendant in the new dictator’s regime, having been rehabilitated enough to <a href="file:///archives/2013/04/01/north-korea-reappoints-reformer-as-premier/">get a political ally appointed to a significant post</a>. Pak Pong-ju was supposed to help promote “reform,” of which precious little has been in evidence, but <a href="http://www.nkleadershipwatch.org/pak-pong-ju/">he’s still in those positions</a>, which suggests that Jang’s offense was personal to Kim — and a coup plot might qualify.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/kim-jong-uns-executed-uncle-jang-song-thaek-stripped-naked-fed-to-120-dogs-as-officials-watched-9037109.html">manner of Jang’s execution</a>
 makes that theory even more plausible, although there is some dispute 
over this account. The Chinese media reported that Jang and his 
associates met their end by getting eaten by wild dogs:</p>
<p>Kim Jong-un’s uncle was killed after being stripped naked and fed to a
 pack of hungry dogs, according to reports in a Chinese state-backed 
newspaper.</p>
<p>North Korea has already described Jang Song Thaek as “despicable 
human scum, worse than a dog,” but the report, which appears in Hong 
Kong’s Wen Wei Po newspaper, suggests he may have met his end in the 
jaws of dogs.</p>
<p>The account – which cannot be verified – describes how Jang Song 
Thaek and five of his aides were stripped naked and fed to 120 hungry 
hounds, who had been starved for three days. The whole process lasted is
 reported to have lasted an hour, and as they were eaten, hundreds of 
officials watched.</p>
<p>The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/world/asia/north-korea-purge.html?pagewanted=all">reported contemporaneously</a>
 that Kim used anti-aircraft weapons rather than dogs to kill Jang’s 
associates. However, they also pointed to a turf war as the proximate 
cause at the time:</p>
<p>During a closed-door meeting on Monday of the South Korean National 
Assembly’s intelligence committee, Nam Jae-joon, the director of the 
National Intelligence Service, disputed the North’s assertion that Mr. 
Jang had tried to usurp his nephew’s power. Rather, he said, Mr. Jang 
and his associates had provoked the enmity of rivals within the North’s 
elite by dominating lucrative business deals, starting with the coal 
badly needed by China, the North’s main trading partner.</p>
<p>“There had been friction building up among the agencies of power in 
North Korea over privileges and over the abuse of power by Jang 
Song-thaek and his associates,” Mr. Nam was quoted as saying. Mr. Nam’s 
comments were relayed to the news media by Jeong Cheong-rae and Cho 
Won-jin, two lawmakers designated as spokesmen for the parliamentary 
committee.</p>
<p>In interviews, officials have said that the friction described in 
general terms to the South Korean Parliament played out in a violent 
confrontation in late September or early October, just north of the 
western sea border between the Koreas.</p>
<p>There, the North harvests one of its major exports: crabs and clams, 
delicacies that are also highly valued by the Chinese. For years the 
profits from those fishing grounds, along with the output from munitions
 factories and trading companies, went directly to the North Korean 
military, helping it feed its troops, and enabling its top officers to 
send cash gifts to the Kim family.</p>
<p>That explanation seems rather disproportionate for the lengths that 
Kim went to humiliate his uncle before dispatching him, however that was
 accomplished. It also leaves unexplained why Kim threw away his working
 relationship with Malaysia to conduct a bizarre and dangerous 
assassination in the Kuala Lumpur airport using VX nerve agent. That 
operation was clearly designed to (a) be very public, and (b) leave no 
doubt as to who ordered the hit. Jong-nam, a dissipated playboy 
ne’er-do-well, would hardly have merited that treatment — unless Kim 
Jong-un knew that China had wanted to use Jong-nam to supplant him once 
and suspected they might try it again.</p>
<p>If true, what does it mean now? One consequence is that China will 
find its options limited when it comes to coup attempts in the future. 
What general would risk working with Beijing to depose Kim after 
watching what happened with Jang? How many other moles does Kim have in 
China’s government, ready to tip him off to the next attempt? China 
still has an enormous amount of economic influence, of course, but they 
may have blown their ability to govern North Korea’s military. That in 
itself is an unsettling thought to consider while Kim Jong-un plays with
 his ICBMs.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">I’ve always felt that DPRK’s nuclear program is aimed at China, as much as it is the USA or Japan</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Why? Because the USA and Japan, the ostensible 
enemies, actually have ZERO influence in the DPRK. There is no business,
 no exchanges, no contacts of any kind. The only thing Kim has to fear 
from the USA or Japan is directly military attack</p>
<p class="rm-manual">China, on the other hand, has had its hands in the 
DPRK since the regime was spawned by Stalin and Mao. They share a 
border, they many business and political contacts. No doubt China also 
has many spies and friends within the DPRK government and military. 
China is the only one who could make “regime-change” in the DPRK.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">As this article points out - from whom does Kim have more to fear?</p>

<p class="rm-manual">I do believe this account.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">My understanding is that China has for at least 10 
or 15 years maintained an entire replacement DPRK cabinet/clique, ready 
to take over in case things go.....errr....south The North, as it were, 
and China wants to do what it can to forestall a huge refugee flood 
crossing the border.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The whole of Korea is pretty attuned to blood 
relations and Un removing Nam would make it more clear that the rest of 
the world really is/was stuck with Un.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> If you go to sites operated by Falun Gong, there 
are many articles on Zhou Yongkang, because he, as a security chief 
under Jiang Zemin, was in charge of brutal crackdown on Falun Gong 
practitioners.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> They claim that Jiang's faction was quite close to N. Korea's Kim Jong-il.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> There is another episode which suggest Kim 
Jong-il's close relationship with Jiang. In his last trip (via train) to
 China, Kim Jong-il went down to Zhengzhou, a provincial city 500 km to 
the south of Beijing, to meet Jiang Zemin. Jiang was spending his time 
there after his retirement.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> That was rather extraordinary for a sentimental courtesy call.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> So it is not unreasonable to assume that N. Korean regime and Jiang's Shanghai Mafia had close relationship. </p>

NK, according to Asahi Shimbun, North Korea has hired former KGB staff
