<p class="">On the 3rd January 2020, a US drone assassinated Brigadier 
General Qassem Soleimani, Commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard 
Corps – Quds Brigade at Baghdad airport. Soleimani had come to Iraq at 
the request of Prime Minister Adil Abdel Mahdi following ongoing 
mediation between Iran and Saudi Arabia- plus a request from President 
Donald Trump for Iraq to convince Iran to de-escalate the high tension 
dominating the Middle East. Soleimani had been also appointed by the 
Iraqi government as a military advisor for the war on ISIS. Destiny 
waited for the Iraqi commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandes to be present 
welcoming Soleimani and be assassinated as well by the US. Over 100 days
 have now gone by. What were the US’s objectives- and what did they 
really achieve? Sardar (Commander) Soleimani was also leading the “Axis 
of the Resistance” that expands from Gaza, Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad, 
Tehran, to Sanaa.</p>
<p class="">Following the assassination of Soleimani, the leader of the 
revolution Sayyed Ali Khamenei replaced him with his deputy, General 
Ismail Qaani. Soleimani had nominated Qaani as his substitute in case of
 martyrdom, a martyrdom Soleimani had aspired to for many years.</p>
<p>The first visit of the Iranian general Qaani was to Syria, where he 
met President Bashar al-Assad (on several occasions). He also visited 
the front line in Aleppo and Idlib (the city hosting “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/13/world/middleeast/idlib-syria-displaced-militants.html">the largest Al Qaeda safe haven since 9/11</a>”),
 and met with field commanders to have a sense of the terrain where his 
officers and allies are deployed, ready to re-take the M4 linking Aleppo
 to Latakia if Turkey failed to remove jihadists along the road.</p>
<p>Sources close to the leaders of the “Axis of the Resistance” said 
that General Qaani “confirmed to President Assad the total support of 
Iran for the stability and unity of the Syrian territory and its effort 
to liberate the country from all occupation forces. Mr Assad thanked the
 Iranian general and expressed his appreciation of Iranian support at a 
time of harsh US sanctions and the spread of the coronavirus.”</p>
<figcaption>Qassem Soleimani with Major General Mohsen Rezaei (Photo Al-Ahed)</figcaption><p>In
 Damascus, Qaani met with Palestinian leaders to reconfirm what was 
agreed upon in Tehran and Iran’s commitment to support the Palestinian 
cause. Qaani also visited Lebanon where he met Hezbollah Secretary 
General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and travelled to Iraq to meet officials,
 as did his late superior Qassem Soleimani. The Iranian officer carried 
one message to all members of the “Axis of the Resistance” he has met: 
Iran considers the “Axis of the Resistance” as part of its national 
security and is determined to increase support to its allies as needed. 
The IRGC-Quds brigade leader is walking in the footsteps of his 
predecessor Qassem Soleimani in shaping personal relationships with his 
allies.</p>
<p>The funerals of Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandes gathered millions
 onto the streets of Iran to rally behind the leaders of the country. 
Before the assassination of these leaders, Iran was suffering unrest 
caused by mobs who encouraged the destabilisation of the country. Over 
731 banks, 307 automobiles and 1076 motorcycles were torched, 140 public
 places, 70 gas stations damaged—evidence of the tangible intention 
behind the protests. After the assassination, Iran was more united than 
ever, notwithstanding the US trying to cripple the country with harsh 
sanctions.</p>
<figcaption>The two IRGC-Quds Brigade commanders Qassem Soleimani and Ismail Qaani.</figcaption><p>President
 Trump and his administration wrongly believed the Iranians would 
consider the assassination an opportunity to rise against the 
leadership, thinking it could weaken the IRGC. The result was completely
 the opposite. In fact, the US President offered a unique gift to the 
unity and solidarity of the Iranians that could only be achieved by 
assassinating a national figure like Soleimani. Not because Soleimani 
was indispensable, but because assassinating a commander who led the war
 against Al-Qaeda and ISIS to protect Iran from the Takfiri was wholly 
unacceptable. The commanders were assassinated by an arrogant leader who
 clearly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-iran/trump-gives-dramatic-account-of-soleimanis-last-minutes-before-death-cnn-idUSKBN1ZH0G3">enjoyed</a>
 about following “the last minutes” before his drone killed Soleimani 
and Muhandes at Baghdad’s airport– a neutral ground where the US is 
supposed to be a guest respecting the rules of the country.</p>
<p>The reaction was spectacular and unexpected: Sayyed Ali Khamenei was 
seen at the operational room giving out orders to hit US objectives. 
Furthermore, Iran used its truck-based launchers to fire its <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/meet-qiam-missile-iran-used-blast-us-airbase-112911">Qiam</a>
 liquid-fuel missiles against US bases in Ayn al-Assad Anbar and Erbil, 
in Iraq. Using a liquid rather than solid fuel indicates that Iran 
deployed the missiles for hours to prepare them for launch, rather than 
minutes as when using solid fuel, giving ample possibility for US 
satellites to see the preparations.</p>
<figcaption>An anonymous group in Iraq joining the resistance against the US troops.</figcaption><p>Indeed,
 the American administration sent an urgent cable to the Swiss embassy 
in Tehran warning Iran against any attack, saying it would be met with 
disproportionate fire-power. Iran responded by giving the exact location
 of the intended bombing, the two US bases, adding that all US military 
bases in the Middle East would be bombed if the US were to retaliate 
against the firing of its ballistic missiles. The importance of this 
“dialogue” reveals the consequences of the US assassination of 
Soleimani: Iran, for the first time, challenged a superpower 
face-to-face, warned it of its bombing intention and specified the 
targets, not only disregarding the US threat but replying with another 
threat that the US has not seen or experienced since World War II.</p>
<p>Iran did not use its allies to attack the US but, under the watchful 
eyes of the world, challenged a superpower that surrounds Iran with 
dozens of military bases. The cost of the assassination of Soleimani 
will enter the history books, and confirms the decline of the US empire.
 A small country with relatively limited military capability challenged 
and hit a superpower with military forces spread throughout the world.</p>
<figcaption>The Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran Sayyed Ali Khamenei.</figcaption><p>The
 US assassinated Soleimani and Iran assassinated the US’s pride and 
image. The US President became a laughing-stock when he later announced 
that over 100 US soldiers had been diagnosed with traumatic <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-tbi-exclusive/exclusive-more-than-100-u-s-troops-diagnosed-with-brain-injuries-from-iran-attack-officials-idUSKBN2041ZK">brain injuries</a>.
 The boost to the “Axis of the Resistance” was unprecedented. Countries 
in the Middle East are not used to vanquishing powerful enemies and must
 always be on the defensive. At the same time as the US believed it was 
breaking Iran’s back with the harshest sanctions ever, the “Islamic 
Republic” showed it was far from ready for submission. The US President,
 Trump, in his term ending this year (or even in a second term, or that 
of any new US President), will fail to impose his terms on an Iran full 
of energy and prepared for all-out war.</p>
<p>The strategic consequences of Soleimani’s assassination and the 
Iranian direct bombing of the US bases are boosting the “Axis of the 
Resistance” as never before. Iran’s allies seem now to have no fear of 
confronting the US face-to-face on any platform. Soleimani was not 
killed on the battlefield but by a drone guided from afar. Iran gave 
notice to the US about the timing of the bombing of its bases and 
fulfilled its plan, allowing US and coalition forces to hide in their 
shelters. The assassination of Soleimani turned against the US and in 
favour of the “Axis of the Resistance”- despite its loss of an important
 leader.</p>
