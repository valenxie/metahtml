<h1 class="rm-manual">North Korea says no interest in Trump summit until 'hostile policy' removed</h1>

<p>SEOUL (Reuters) - A senior North Korean official said on Wednesday 
that the United States must drop its “hostile policy” towards Pyongyang 
in order to restart stalled denuclearisation talks, South Korea’s Yonhap
 news agency reported. </p>

<p>Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui told reporters after meeting 
Russian officials in Moscow it would be “impossible” to hold another 
summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald
 Trump if he maintains his current stance towards the North. </p>
<p>“To negotiate with the United States going forward, we would be able 
to discuss nuclear issues again when it withdraws all of its hostile 
policy against us,” Choe said, according to Yonhap. </p>
<p>“In that sense, I think a summit should not really be an issue of our interest.” </p>
<p>She did not specify what constituted such a policy, but North Korea’s
 foreign ministry said on Sunday that a recent United Nations resolution
 on its human rights was a U.S.-led “political provocation”. </p>
<p>North Korea has also called for an end to joint military drills with 
South Korea, as well as sanctions that crippled its economy. </p>
<p>When asked what U.S. action was needed to restart the talks, Choe said the Americans “know very well”. </p>
<p>“The U.S. side will have to lift all measures with which they treat 
us as an enemy and then inform us of such a strategic decision,” she 
said. </p>
<p>Kim and Trump held a first, landmark summit in Singapore in June last
 year and agreed to improve relations and negotiate an end to North 
Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes. </p>
<p>The efforts have made no substantial progress and their second summit collapsed in Vietnam in February. </p>

</ul>
<p>The two leaders agreed in June, at a third meeting at the 
inter-Korean border, to re-open negotiations. But working-level talks in
 October between officials in Sweden ended with the North Korean envoy 
accusing the Americans of coming to the table empty-handed. </p>
<p>Choe, one of North Korea’s key nuclear negotiators, met Russian 
officials including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on 
Wednesday, Yonhap said. </p>
<p>Her remarks were the latest in a series of statements in recent weeks
 by senior Pyongyang officials calling for U.S. action, as a year-end 
deadline set by Kim for Washington to show more flexibility draws near. </p>
