<h1 class="rm-manual">Anonymous 2 - Facebook </h1>
<p class="rm-manual">Another anonymous Facebook employee leaked to 
Project Veritas a supposed confidential internal HR memo that showed 
H-1B applicants were being favored over American workers.</p>
<p>Project Veritas released a story featuring a human resources 
memorandum prioritizing overseas nationals to reduce the number of 
American employees by an another anonymous Facebook Insider.</p>
<p>The confidential Facebook memorandum explicitly stated: “Priority may
 be given to H-1B applicants from China and Korea to foster larger 
communities of diverse workers at Facebook.” However, when asked for 
comment, Facebook adamantly opposed the authenticity then refused to 
answer any additional questions.</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/syq3snmxclc9/6hs40WxW81b8GKbvrkONbX/1181a4a7552e5e514e8a3b61f09d7fe1/FB_New_Memo.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">READ THE ENTIRE LEAKED FACEBOOK MEMO #8744 HERE</a></p>
<p>Andy Stone, the policy communications director for Facebook told 
James O’Keefe, the founder and CEO of Project Veritas, the document was 
not real in a phone call, but wouldn’t go further.</p>
<p>O’Keefe said Facebook is posturing, rather than addressing the issues in the leaked</p>
<p>memo.</p>
<p>“The social media giant is clearly taking a defensive stance which 
raises questions beyond the document. Their corporate posture is telling
 that while a record number of Americans are looking for work, one of 
America's leading companies is credited with a memo targeting 
recruitment of foreign workers by nationality, then suspending six 
employees they suspect</p>
<p>of revealing it. It doesn’t add up,” O’Keefe said.</p>
<p>Immediately following Stone’s comments O’Keefe spoke with the Insider
 via Skype who was simultaneously losing access to his workplace 
accounts.</p>
<p>“I'm not sure why this is happening or what's going on. I'm not 
receiving any responses from anyone. I'm reaching out to multiple 
people, and I have yet to hear back from anybody,” said the Insider.</p>
<p>In a previous interview with O’Keefe, the Insider said the H-1B 
policy memo was acquired after it had come across his desk in “normal 
operation. The insider grew concerned after reading the Diversity 
Initiative Board described in the memo, was to create internal momentum 
for diversity while highlighting: “…Priority may be given to H-1B 
applicants from China and Korea to foster larger communities of diverse 
workers at Facebook.”</p>
<p>The H-1B Visa program was enacted in 1990 to help the Pentagon and 
American companies fill high-skill positions, according to the USCIS 
website:</p>
<p>This visa category applies to people who wish to perform services in a
 specialty occupation, services of exceptional merit and ability 
relating to a Department of Defense cooperative research and development
 project, or services as a fashion model of distinguished merit or 
ability.</p>
<p>Mr. X, the Facebook insider, told O’Keefe during his first interview he was motivated to come forward to right wrongs.</p>
<p>Mr. X: “In my normal course of work, it happened to come across my 
desk and, uh, I noticed it and, and I sort of read over it and came to, 
came to the knowledge of it that way.</p>
<p>James O’Keefe: What bothers you most about this document?</p>
<p>Mr. X: “The fact that there's so much, um, that is asked to be kept 
secret, bothers me extensively. I think that if there's forces that are 
making decisions, people have a right to know if those, especially if 
those decisions affect them.”</p>
<p>When Project Veritas followed up by phone and email before deadline, 
the company refused to comment on the existence of “Diversity Initiative
 Board (DIB), their H-1B visa policy and why priority may be given to 
Chinese and Korean nationals over Americans.</p>
<p>Another troubling trend in the high-tech company is hiring American 
workers, only to have them train and acclimate foreign workers to do 
their jobs—before they are let go, leaving the foreign workers to 
continue.</p>
<p>“I know several people who were invited in to work,” he said. “They 
were given 60 days, and the first 30 days they had someone shadow them 
and the next 30 days someone trained them and then they were then 
released,” he said.</p>
<p>“I've seen the destruction and the damage that this H-1B visa issue 
has caused living in the [San Francisco] Bay area,” the insider said.</p>
<p>"There is a very large portion of homeless, and within that homeless,
 there's a very large portion of working homeless that are, these are 
Americans with degrees and jobs that no longer have these jobs and have 
been replaced by H-1B visa workers. It's damaging overall. And I feel 
that this has to stop--someone needs to do something,” he said.</p>
<p>Steve R. Klein, a constitutional lawyer, told O’Keefe that employment
 practices spelled out in the confidential Facebook document potentially
 create both federal and California legal jeopardy for the company.</p>
<p>“…this document that not only is that discriminating against 
Americans or suggesting a policy that does that, it's also even within 
the H-1B process, saying that applicants from China and Korea will be 
prioritized to foster larger communities of diverse workers and</p>
<p>Facebook,” Klein said.</p>
<p>Klein told O'Keefe: “California employment law really parallels the 
federal Civil Rights Act in a lot of important respects, and if this is 
policy that's being implemented at Facebook, it should raise concerns 
among people applying to Facebook.”</p>
<p>Under federal law, penalties for aggrieved applicants or employees 
can include back pay, costs, civil fines, injunctive relief such as 
reinstatement or promotion, attorney fees, and pain and suffering 
damages up to $300,000, Klein said.</p>
<p>At the end of the interview, O'Keefe conducted with Mr. X, he asked him about his role as a Project Veritas insider.</p>
<p>“Mr. X, let me ask you this question. If another insider were to ask 
you, well, should I go to project Veritas, what would you tell them?” he
 asked.</p>
<p class="">“I would tell them: yes. I believe they have the resources 
to assist you, and they take confidentiality quite seriously, and they 
will listen if, if no one else will, if you do feel that whoever you're 
involved with, whatever large corporation that is.”</p>
