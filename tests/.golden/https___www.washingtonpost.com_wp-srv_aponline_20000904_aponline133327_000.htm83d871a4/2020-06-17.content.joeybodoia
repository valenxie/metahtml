<table class=""> <tbody><tr class=""> <td class=""> Army Asked To Fight 
Mosquito Virus By David Dishneau Associated Press Writer Monday, Sept. 
4, 2000; 1:33 p.m. EDT FREDERICK, Md. –– In a sealed laboratory, 
scrub-suited Army scientists are probing the mysteries of mosquitoes 
that spread the West Nile virus, including one that could be especially 
adept at transmitting the sometimes deadly disease. <p> Controlling the 
U.S. outbreak of West Nile, which has killed seven people and sickened 
scores more since it first appeared in the country last year, depends 
partly on entomologist Michael Turell and his six-person team at the 
U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease at Fort 
Detrick. </p>
<p> Their subjects include Aedes japonicus, an Asian mosquito species 
relatively new to this country. Although the main culprits so far have 
been common backyard mosquitoes in the Culex family, scientists say 
japonicus may be more capable of carrying the virus far from the New 
York City area, where all the U.S. deaths so far have happened. </p>
<p> "There is no question it is going to be a player," Turell said. "But
 is its role going to be the 10th most important mosquito or the second 
most important mosquito? That we don't know." </p>
<p> Where does it breed? When does it feed? What does it bite? Those are
 the questions the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants
 answered. </p>
<p> The agency asked the Army to join the West Nile fight shortly after 
the virus appeared for the first time in the Western Hemisphere last 
September, said Stephen Ostroff, West Nile coordinator at the CDC. 
Scientists at Fort Detrick develop defenses to germ warfare, but they 
also have battled outbreaks of Ebola and other exotic diseases around 
the world. </p>
<p> "The role that they are playing is a very important one," Ostroff 
said. The more the CDC knows about the mosquitoes that transmit the 
virus, the better it can advise the public on how to reduce the risk of 
infection, he said. </p>
<p> Scientists at Rutgers and Fordham universities also are studying links between West Nile and mosquitoes. </p>
<p> The researchers call the mosquitoes "vectors" – organisms that 
transmit the virus by feeding on infected animals, especially crows, and
 then biting uninfected ones, such as humans. Some mosquito species are 
more competent vectors than others, and Turell has found that Aedes 
japonicus is among the best. </p>
<p> In laboratory tests, japonicus has been four to five times more 
effective than Culex pipiens in transmitting West Nile from infected 
chickens to virus-free chickens, he said. </p>
<p> Still, that doesn't necessarily mean japonicus is a competent vector
 in the wild. Scientists know it breeds in old tires, which puts it 
close to people, and that it feeds in the daytime. But they don't know 
if it feeds in the evening, when crows are roosting, or even if it feeds
 much on birds. </p>
<p> "The problem of trying to find a fed mosquito in the middle of a forest is extremely difficult," Turell said. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, researchers found the West Nile virus in a few swarms 
of japonicus mosquitoes in New York's Westchester County, where one of 
the West Nile deaths happened. The virus also has been found in at least
 five other mosquito species. </p>
<p> Researchers are intrigued by findings that japonicus and West Nile 
share much of the same U.S. territory. In the past two years, they have 
found the mosquitoes for the first time in most of the seven states – 
Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New 
York and Rhode Island – where infected birds have been recovered. </p>
<p> "That's a pretty rapid spread for a mosquito in only two breeding 
seasons," Ostroff said. "If it continues to move at the pace it appears 
to have been moving, the potential to carry the virus farther afield is a
 cause for concern." </p>
<p> Scientists are less concerned, though, about japonicus' ability to 
transmit the virus to humans – mainly because the evidence is scanty. </p>
<p> "This is the first time West Nile and japonicus have ever been in 
the same place at the same time," Turell said. He said the mosquito 
isn't found in Romania or southwestern Russia, the sites of other recent
 West Nile outbreaks. And in the Far East, where japonicus is common, 
West Nile fever is rare. </p>
<p> Ostroff said he was gratified that while the virus appears to be 
spreading among wild birds and insects, there has not been a rapid 
increase in human infections. Seven cases of human infection have been 
reported so far this year – six in New York and one in New Jersey – with
 no deaths. </p>
<p> "We have always acknowledged there isn't any way to prevent 100 
percent of human illness, but what we could do is work to minimize the 
amount of human illness that we would see," Ostroff said. "I'd like to 
believe we're actually accomplishing some of that." </p>
