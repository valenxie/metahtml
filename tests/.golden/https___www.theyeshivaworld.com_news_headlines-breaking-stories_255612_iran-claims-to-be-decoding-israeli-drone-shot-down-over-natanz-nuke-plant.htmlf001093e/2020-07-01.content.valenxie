<h1 class="rm-manual">Iran Claims To Be ‘Decoding Israeli Drone Shot Down Over Natanz Nuke Plant’</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span>August 24, 2014 1:49 pm</span> </p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/255612/iran-claims-to-be-decoding-israeli-drone-shot-down-over-natanz-nuke-plant.html#comments">3</a></p>
<p>The following is via the Iranian Fars News Agency:</p>
<p>The IRGC Aerospace Force <a href="https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/255533/iran-says-it-downs-israeli-drone-near-nuclear-site.html">shot down an Israeli spy drone</a> before it could reach Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, in Central Iran, on Sunday.</p>
<p>Director of the IRGC’s Public Relations Department General Ramezan 
Sharif told FNA later on Sunday night that some of the parts of the 
downed aircraft are working, “and our experts are studying the 
information and intelligence of these parts”.</p>
<p>“We are now analyzing the information of this plane,” he added.</p>
<p>Gen. Sharif further mentioned that Commander of the IRGC Aerospace 
Force Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh will soon reveal more details
 on the spy drone and the way it has been hunted down by his forces.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the IRGC Public Relations Department said in a 
statement that the Israeli pilotless aircraft was a radar-evading, 
stealth drone with the mission to spy on Iran’s enrichment activities by
 flying over Natanz nuclear enrichment plant.</p>
<p>The IRGC also pointed out in its statement that the Israeli hostile aircraft has been targeted by a surface-to-air missile.</p>
<p>“This mischievous attempt once again made the adventurous nature of 
the Zionist regime more evident and added another black page to the dark
 record of this fake and warmongering regime, which is full of crimes 
and wickedness,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The IRGC further warned that it “preserves the right of response and retaliation for itself”.</p>
<p>It also noted that the IRGC alongside other Armed Forces of the 
Islamic Republic is fully and resolutely ready to defend the noble 
Iranian nation and Islamic Iran.</p>
<p>Iran has so far downed several US drones in the last few years. In 
the most notable case the country announced on December 4, 2011 that its
 defense forces had downed a US RQ-170 aircraft through a sophisticated 
cyber attack. The drone was the first such loss by the US. US officials 
have described the loss of the aircraft in Iran as a setback and a fatal
 blow to the stealth drone program.</p>
<p>The aircraft is among the highly sensitive surveillance platform in 
the CIA’s fleet that was shaped and designed to evade enemy defenses.</p>
<p>Since December, 2011, Iran has hunted down several more US drones of various types.</p>
<p>In January 2013, a deputy commander of the Iranian Navy announced 
that the country’s Army had hunted two more advanced RQ type UAVs.</p>
<p>“The air-defense units of the Army have hunted two enemy drones,” 
Deputy Commander of the Iranian Navy for Coordination Rear Admiral Amir 
Rastegari told FNA.</p>
<p>“These drones were from 11th series of the RQ class, and one of them 
was hunted in Shahrivar 1390 (August 21-September 19, 2011) and the 
other one in Aban (October 22-November 20, 2012),” Rastegari said, 
adding that the Army research center is now studying the two UAVs.</p>
<p>“Much of the data of these drones has been decoded by the Army’s 
Jihad and Research Center,” he said, but did not provide any further 
detail.</p>
<p>The remarks by the Iranian commander came after Iran announced on 
December 4, 2012 that the IRGC Navy had hunted a US UAV over the Persian
 Gulf after the drone violated the country’s airspace.</p>
<p>The IRGC navy commander announced at the time that the hunted UAV was
 a ScanEagle drone, adding that “such drones are usually launched from 
large warships”.</p>
<p>ScanEagle is a small, low-cost, long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle built by Insitu, a subsidiary of Boeing.</p>
<p>Iran later reproduced its own model of ScanEagle through reverse engineering techniques.</p>
<p>Iran has downed many other US drones as well, and they have always 
started reproducing them after conducting reverse engineering on them.</p>
<p>The unmanned surveillance plane lost by the United States in Iran was
 a stealth aircraft being used for secret missions by the CIA, US 
officials admitted in December. The aircraft is among the highly 
sensitive surveillance platform in the CIA’s fleet that was shaped and 
designed to evade enemy defenses.</p>
<p>In December, Lieutenant Commander of the IRGC Brigadier General 
Hossein Salami announced that the Iranian version of the US drone, 
RQ-170, would be unveiled to the public soon.</p>
<p>“The construction of this drone will finish soon and most of the job 
has been done now,” General Salami told reporters on the sidelines of a 
conference in Tehran in December, 2013.</p>
<p>In relevant remarks in October, Commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force
 Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh said that Iran moved as much as 35
 years ahead in building drone engines by reverse engineering the US 
drone, RQ-170 which was tracked and hunted down in Iran late in 2011.</p>
<p>The RQ-170 engines are the fifth generation and the engines of 
Iranian unmanned planes are the third generation, Hajizadeh said, adding
 that to produce the engine we had to spend 35 years on the project.</p>
<p>He said that the home-made version of the US drone RQ-170 captured by the IRGC would make its maiden flight in the near future.</p>
<p>In April, 2013, a senior Iranian parliamentary official announced 
that Iran has reverse engineered the RQ-170, adding that the Iranian 
version of the drone would soon have a test flight.</p>
<p>“The brave personnel of the Armed Forces hunted down the drone with 
their knowledge and science and the Americans protested immediately and 
called for the return of the UAV,” Chairman of the parliament’s National
 Security and Foreign Policy Commission Alaeddin Boroujerdi said in the 
Northern city of Rasht last April.</p>
<p>Iran has downed several US drones so far and Boroujerdi did not 
mention which one he meant, but explained, “The reverse engineering 
started immediately (by the Iranian experts after hunting down the US 
UAV) and the Iranian type of the US drone will fly in Iran’s Aerospace 
Organization soon which shows the Islamic Republic’s might and power.”</p>
